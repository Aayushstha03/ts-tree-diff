					<p>At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
						and the interest rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</p>
					<h2>Underlying inflation remains too high.</h2>
					<p>Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to
						bring aggregate demand and supply closer towards balance. Measures of underlying inflation are around
						3½&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, which is still some way from the 2.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent midpoint of the inflation
						target.</p>
					<p>The most recent forecasts published in the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> (SMP) do not
						see inflation returning sustainably to the midpoint of the target until 2026. The Board is gaining some
						confidence that inflationary pressures are declining in line with these recent forecasts, but risks
						remain.</p>
					<h2>The outlook remains uncertain.</h2>
					<p>While underlying inflation is still high, other recent data on economic activity have been mixed, but on
						balance softer than expected in November.</p>
					<p>Growth in output has been weak. National accounts for the September quarter show that the economy grew by
						only 0.8&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent over the past year. Outside of the <span class="no-wrap">COVID-19</span>
						pandemic, this is the slowest pace of growth since the early 1990s. Past declines in real disposable
						income and the ongoing effect of restrictive financial conditions continued to weigh on household
						consumption spending, particularly on discretionary items.</p>
					<p>A range of indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain tight; while those conditions have been
						easing gradually, some indicators have recently stabilised. The unemployment rate was
						4.1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in October, up from 3.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in late 2022. That said, employment
						grew strongly over the three months to October, the participation rate remains close to record highs,
						vacancies are still relatively high and average hours worked have stabilised. At the same time, some
						cyclical labour market indicators, including youth unemployment and underemployment rates, have recently
						declined.</p>
					<p>Wage pressures have eased more than expected in the November SMP. The rate of wages growth as measured by
						the Wage Price Index was 3.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent over the year to the September quarter, a step down from
						the previous quarter, but labour productivity growth remains weak.</p>
					<p>Taking account of recent data, the Board’s assessment is that monetary policy remains restrictive and
						is working as anticipated. Some of the upside risks to inflation appear to have eased and while the level
						of aggregate demand still appears to be above the economy’s supply capacity, that gap continues to
						close.</p>
					<p>The central projection is for growth in household consumption to increase as income growth rises.
						September quarter data suggest that both incomes and consumption had recovered a little slower than
						forecast, but more recent information has suggested a pick-up in consumption in October and November.
						There is a risk that any pick-up in consumption is slower than expected, resulting in continued subdued
						output growth and a sharper deterioration in the labour market. More broadly, there are uncertainties
						regarding the lags in the effect of monetary policy and how firms’ pricing decisions and wages will
						respond to the slow growth in the economy and weak productivity outcomes at a time of excess demand, and
						while conditions in the labour market remain tight.</p>
					<p>There remains a high level of uncertainty about the outlook abroad. Most central banks have eased monetary
						policy as they become more confident that inflation is moving sustainably back towards their respective
						targets. They note, however, that they are removing only some restrictiveness and remain alert to risks
						in both directions, namely weaker labour markets and stronger inflation. Geopolitical uncertainties
						remain pronounced.</p>
					<h2>Sustainably returning inflation to target is the priority.</h2>
					<p>Sustainably returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the Board’s highest
						priority. This is consistent with the RBA’s mandate for price stability and full employment. To
						date, longer term inflation expectations have been consistent with the inflation target and it is
						important that this remains the case.</p>
					<p>While headline inflation has declined substantially and will remain lower for a time, underlying inflation
						is more indicative of inflation momentum, and it remains too high. The November SMP forecasts suggest
						that it will be some time yet before inflation is sustainably in the target range and approaching the
						midpoint. Recent data on inflation and economic conditions are still consistent with these forecasts, and
						the Board is gaining some confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards target.</p>
					<p>The Board will continue to rely upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions.
						In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets,
						trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains
						resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that
						outcome.</p>
