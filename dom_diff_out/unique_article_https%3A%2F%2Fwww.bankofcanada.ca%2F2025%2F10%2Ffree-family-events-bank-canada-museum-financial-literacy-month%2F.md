    Tariffs are significantly higher than they were at the start of 2025, and it is extremely difficult to predict how US trade policy will play out. Canadian economic activity has slowed but is showing signs of resilience. While inflation is close to 2%, underlying inflation has picked up.

This November, the Bank of Canada Museum invites visitors to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Financial Literacy Month (FLM) with a full lineup of free, hands-on activities that make money management approachable, practical, and fun for all ages.

Since its launch in 2011, Financial Literacy Month has been observed every November as a national initiative to strengthen Canadians’ knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing money. Led by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC), FLM brings together partners from across the country to help Canadians make informed financial decisions and build a stronger financial future.

This year’s theme, “Let’s Talk Money,” encourages open conversations about money. At the Bank of Canada Museum, visitors will find a mix of playful activities for children, practical workshops for adults, and tailored offerings for teachers.

Event Highlights  
------------------

*   **Money Fair (Nov. 1):** A community kick-off featuring experts from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the Canada Education Savings Program, MediaSmarts and more. Learn about taxes, savings, fraud prevention – all under one roof.
*   **Financial Literacy Workshops (Nov. 8–9 and 15–16):** Practical sessions for newcomers and parents, hosted by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, with practical advice on managing money in Canada.
*   **Avatar Market Game (Weekends):** Kids take on the role of budget-savvy shoppers, balancing needs and wants while sticking to a $15 budget.
*   **Creative Crafts (All Month):** From colouring financial goal-trackers to papercraft piggy banks, children can bring home reminders of smart saving.
*   **Virtual “All About Money” Presentations (Nov. 18 and 19):** Elementary students and classrooms from across Canada can tune in to learn about the fascinating world of Canadian money.
*   **Teacher Incentive (All Month):** Teachers who visit receive a free classroom resource kit to bring financial literacy into their lessons.
