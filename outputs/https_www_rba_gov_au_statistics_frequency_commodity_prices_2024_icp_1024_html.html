							Preliminary estimates for October indicate that the index increased by 4.1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (on a
							monthly average basis) in SDR terms, after decreasing by 3.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in September
							(revised). The non-rural, rural, and base metal subindices all increased in the month. In
							Australian dollar terms, the index increased by 4.0&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in October.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the past year, the index has decreased by 7.8&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in SDR terms, led by lower iron
							ore and coking coal prices. The index has decreased by 11.1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in Australian dollar
							terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Consistent with previous releases, preliminary estimates for iron ore, coking coal, thermal
							coal and LNG export prices are being used for the most recent months, based on market
							information. Using spot prices for the bulk commodities index, the index increased by 7.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
							in October in SDR terms, to be 9.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent lower over the past year.
