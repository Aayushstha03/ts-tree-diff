### The Federal Reserve Board's Role

As the issuing authority for all Federal Reserve notes, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has a wide range of responsibilities related to paper money, from ensuring an adequate supply to protecting and maintaining confidence in our currency. Together with our partners at the [Treasury Department](http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx), its [Bureau of Engraving and Printing](http://www.moneyfactory.gov/), and the [United States Secret Service](http://www.secretservice.gov/), we continuously monitor the counterfeiting threats for each denomination and make redesign decisions based on these threats.
