									The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research
									Centre (DFCRC) today
									published a <a href="/payments-and-infrastructure/central-bank-digital-currency/pdf/project-acacia-consultation-paper-2024-11.pdf">consultation paper</a> which seeks industry feedback on a new
									research initiative,
									Project Acacia.
									This project will explore how different forms of digital money and associated
									infrastructure could support the development of wholesale tokenised asset markets in
									Australia. It was flagged in the roadmap set out in the recent joint <a href="/payments-and-infrastructure/central-bank-digital-currency/pdf/cbdc-and-the-future-of-digital-money-in-australia.pdf">RBA-Treasury
									paper</a> and related <a href="/speeches/2024/sp-ag-2024-09-18.html">speech</a> on central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the future of
									digital money in Australia.
								</p>
								<p>
									The consultation paper seeks expressions of interest from industry in participating
									in an experimental research phase for Project Acacia, and in joining an Industry
									Advisory Group for the project. Input is also sought on the technical and functional
									capabilities of new forms of settlement infrastructure and digital money, including
									wholesale CBDC and tokenised bank deposits, that could promote well-functioning
									tokenised asset markets and stability in the financial system. Responses to the
									consultation paper are requested by Wednesday 11 December 2024 via
									<a href="mailto:projectacacia@rba.gov.au">projectacacia@rba.gov.au</a>.
								</p>

									Brad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System) at the RBA said, ‘Shaping the
									future of money in Australia is a strategic priority of the RBA and the Payments
									System Board. The RBA, alongside the DFCRC, are seeking to engage with industry
									partners on Project Acacia to examine how innovation in wholesale markets could be
									enabled by new forms of digital money and supporting infrastructure. The role that
									tokenised asset markets could play in improving the efficiency and resilience of
									wholesale payments and settlements, and in enhancing cross-border payments, are
									areas of particular interest. Our overarching aim here is to help address the larger
									question of how innovation in our financial system can best support the Australian
									economy in the digital age.’
