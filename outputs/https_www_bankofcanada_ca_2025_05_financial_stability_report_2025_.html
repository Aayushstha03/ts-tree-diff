<p>As the trade war unfolds, the Bank will be closely watching the risks around debt serviceability and market functioning. The main near-term concern is the risk of a disorderly market sell-off. Over time, the risks to household and business income, and by extension to banks, could grow if the economic impacts of the trade war were to increase. Interconnections in the financial system could amplify the impacts if risks were to materialize (<a href="#box2">Box&nbsp;2</a>).</p>
<p>As the policies of the US administration disrupt global trade, they could also reshape the international financial and monetary system. There are signs that investors have been rebalancing some of their exposure away from US assets toward other markets. At this stage, it is not clear whether this is a short-lived adjustment or a process that will build and gain momentum over time. Such adjustments could lead to sharp increases in the risk premium that investors require to hold US assets. Drastic shifts in global financial flows have the potential to disrupt liquidity in core funding markets and cause stress across the global financial system.</p>
<p>In the current context, the Bank will closely monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indicators</strong><strong> of financial stress</strong>—such as delinquency rates for businesses and households, especially for consumer credit products</li>
<li><strong>Evidence of precautionary behaviour by financial system participants</strong>—such as borrowers drawing on lines of credit more than usual, many investors abruptly moving away from risky assets and leveraged positions, or banks building additional capacity to absorb losses</li>
<li><strong>Availability of credit</strong>—including the extent to which households and businesses can refinance existing borrowing or fund new credit, particularly for workers and firms in sectors heavily exposed to tariffs</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for funding and market liquidity</strong>—especially evidence of rapid or persistent deterioration in core funding markets such as government bond and repo markets</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bank will continue to work closely with federal and provincial financial authorities to monitor and assess the health of Canada’s financial system and to address potential emerging issues. The objective is to foster a stable and resilient financial system that absorbs shocks and can support the economy through periods of turbulence.</p>
</div><div><h2>Households</h2>
<p>Many households continue to adjust to the higher debt-servicing costs that were a key concern in the previous Report. Mortgage holders have proved resilient in the face of higher payments. Signs of financial stress have increased over the past 12&nbsp;months but remain concentrated among households without a mortgage.</p>
<p>While interest rates have come down significantly over the past year, previous increases in interest rates are still affecting mortgage renewals. A large share of mortgages being renewed this year or next were taken out during the pandemic at historically low interest rates. Despite rates being much lower than they were 12&nbsp;months ago, most of these households will still see payment increases when they renew.</p>
<p>In past Reports, the Bank has regularly highlighted the vulnerability in the financial system created by high household indebtedness. While indebtedness remains elevated, it has come down over the past 12&nbsp;months—the ratio of household debt to disposable income has declined from 179% to 173%. With interest rates lower now than a year ago, the Bank is less concerned than it was about the impact of high borrowing costs on debt serviceability.</p>
<p>However, the trade war is threatening jobs and incomes, particularly in trade-dependent industries. Some affected households may become unable to continue making debt payments. In turn, this could lead to credit losses at banks (see <a href="#if1">In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability</a>).</p>
<h3>Signs of financial stress remain concentrated among households without a mortgage</h3>
<p>Since the previous Report, rates of arrears on credit cards and auto loans have risen further for households without a mortgage (<a href="#chart1">Chart&nbsp;1</a>). After falling to historically low levels during the pandemic, these arrears rates are now back above their historical levels.</p>
<p>For households with a mortgage, rates of arrears on consumer credit products have also risen over the past 12&nbsp;months but remain below historical averages.</p>
</div><div><h2>Banks</h2>
<p>Canadian banks remain well positioned to support the financial system and the broader economy, even through a period of financial stress. They have good access to funding through deposits and wholesale markets, and credit performance has been strong. They have increased their accumulated provisions—funds set aside for anticipated loan losses—and they maintain elevated levels of capital to absorb unexpected losses. They also continue to hold sufficient liquidity to meet their short-term obligations.</p>
<p>Prolonged and heightened financial stress on households and businesses would eventually spread to banks through higher credit losses. Banks could pull back on lending if losses affected their earnings and, at the extreme, their level of capital. That would add further stress on the economy and challenge overall financial stability (see <a href="#if1">In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability</a>).</p>
<h3>Canadian banks maintain good access to funding</h3>
<p>Banks have two main sources of funding: customer deposits and funds borrowed through wholesale capital markets. Both have remained readily available over the past 12&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Bank deposits have continued to grow. Deposits at large banks grew 10% from March&nbsp;2024 to March&nbsp;2025. Yet the composition of bank deposits has shifted. In 2022 and 2023, when interest rates were elevated, households and businesses tended to prefer term deposits over demand deposits. The higher interest rates also increased competition for deposits. As interest rates have come down, deposit growth has been gradually shifting away from term deposits and back to demand deposits.</p>
<p>Investor appetite for bank debt remained strong in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025; as a result, access to funding has been steady, and credit spreads for bank debt issued in wholesale markets have remained narrow (<a href="#chart5">Chart&nbsp;5</a>).</p>
