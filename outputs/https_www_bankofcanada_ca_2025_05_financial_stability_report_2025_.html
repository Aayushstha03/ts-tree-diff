<div class="bocss-box" style="padding: 1px 15px 10px 15px !important;">
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canada’s financial system is resilient. Overall, households, businesses, banks and non-bank financial intermediaries successfully weathered the pandemic, a period of elevated inflation, and sharp increases in interest rates.</li>
<li>Over the past 12 months, Canadian households have been carrying, on average, less debt relative to their income, and insolvency filings by businesses have dropped significantly. But there are pockets of financial stress. The economic impacts of the pandemic, as well as elevated housing prices due to persistent imbalances in the housing market, have led to higher levels of debt for some households and businesses. This has made them more vulnerable to financial shocks.</li>
<li>Because Canadian households and businesses have remained resilient overall, financial institutions have not come under stress. Canadian banks have generally maintained elevated capital buffers and have increased provisions for credit losses. Liquidity levels have remained high, and access to funding has continued to be strong.</li>
<li>Recently, large and abrupt shifts in the direction of US trade policy have led to some bouts of extreme market volatility, including in the normally low-risk market for US Treasuries. This volatility tested the resilience of market participants—particularly non-bank financial intermediaries deploying arbitrage strategies in the US Treasury market.</li>
<li>The trade war currently threatens the Canadian economy and poses risks to financial stability. Near-term unpredictability of US trade and economic policy could cause further market volatility and a sharp repricing in assets, leading to strains on liquidity. In extreme circumstances, market volatility could turn into market dysfunction.</li>
<li>In the medium to long term, a prolonged global trade war would have severe economic consequences. It would reduce economic growth and increase unemployment. Some households and businesses would be unable to continue making debt payments. If household and business credit defaults were to occur on a large scale, banks could see greater losses than they have provisioned for. This could lead them to pull back on lending, potentially exacerbating economic and financial stress.</li>
<li>The Bank of Canada is watching developments closely and remains in regular contact with financial system participants and with other financial authorities in Canada and globally. A stable and resilient financial system—one that absorbs shocks and does not amplify them—can help the economy through periods of turbulence.</li>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h3>The financial system began 2025 with increased resilience</h3>
<p>From the time of the 2024 Report until the beginning of 2025, major central banks eased monetary policy as inflation fell worldwide. Lower policy interest rates helped reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system related to debt serviceability.</p>
<p>Despite brief periods of volatility in global markets, Canadian fixed-income and other core funding markets functioned well, and debt issuance conditions remained solid. Banks maintained elevated levels of capital and liquid assets. Non-financial businesses also kept healthy balance sheets. As interest rates declined, the pressure on businesses and households with variable-rate debt and those facing mortgage renewals also eased.</p>
<p>At the same time, some risks increased. Financial asset prices rose, and valuations in some markets appeared elevated. Global debt levels also increased. Leverage of some non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) continued to grow alongside a rise in their participation in core funding markets.</p>
<h3>The trade war and pervasive uncertainty have rattled markets</h3>
<p>Since January, the unpredictability of US trade policy has caused a sharp increase in uncertainty and market volatility. The new tariffs announced by the United States in early April were significantly larger than market participants had anticipated. This led to sharp repricing in equity, bond and currency markets as investors revised their economic outlooks. Benchmark equity indexes fell sharply before recovering almost entirely, while stock market volatility rose to its highest level since the COVID-19 crisis. Sovereign bond yields in Canada and the United States saw large swings. Many investors appeared to diversify away from US assets. The US dollar and US Treasuries weakened in tandem with stocks instead of playing their traditional safe-haven roles amid uncertainty. Part of that weakening may reflect an unwinding of leveraged positions by hedge funds and other market participants.</p>
<p>Even as volatility spiked and liquidity at times diminished in some asset classes, markets continued to function relatively well both globally and in Canada. But market participants in Canada have been cautious. Some have pre-emptively adjusted their portfolios or investment strategies, reduced the amount of risk they take on or sought additional protection against losses. Many are also reviewing whether their hedging strategies need to be adjusted to reflect recent market conditions.</p>
<p>The trade war and ensuing uncertainty have reshaped the global backdrop, lowering the prospects for global growth and raising inflation expectations.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable households and businesses may struggle with debt, causing credit losses</h3>
<p>In Canada, uncertainty about the scope and duration of the trade war has weighed on consumer and business sentiment and decisions.</p>
<p>To assess how a trade war could affect the Canadian economic outlook, the Bank’s April&nbsp;2025 <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-04-16/"><em>Monetary Policy Report</em></a> (MPR) presented two illustrative scenarios spanning a wide range of paths for US trade policy. In Scenario&nbsp;1, most new tariffs get negotiated away and their impact is limited, although uncertainty remains. In Scenario&nbsp;2, a long-lasting global trade war with large and permanent tariffs brings severe economic consequences for Canada, including a year-long recession. These are two of many possible outcomes and, importantly, they are not forecasts.</p>
<p>At the same time, the MPR acknowledged the presence of further downside risks to these scenarios from potential worsening of financial stress. Permanent tariffs could cause high unemployment and business insolvencies that result in defaults on household and business debt. This would lead to credit losses for banks and would test the financial system’s resilience.</p>
<p>Canadian banks have maintained healthy balance sheets, putting them in a good position to absorb higher credit losses (<a href="#box1">Box&nbsp;1</a>). Nevertheless, credit losses could lead banks to reduce lending. This could exacerbate an economic downturn.</p>
<h3>The trade war increases the risk of disorderly market sell-offs</h3>
<p>Continued US trade policy uncertainty could spur further market volatility and an abrupt repricing of assets, which in turn could lead to acute and persistent liquidity pressures that test the financial system’s resilience.<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1" title="Asked what could trigger a severe repricing in markets, respondents to the Bank’s 2025 Financial System Survey mentioned a trade war most often, followed by geopolitical tensions." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></p>
<p>A further correction in asset prices could be amplified if leveraged investors were to quickly unwind their trading positions. Asset managers might hoard cash and sell fixed-income assets to meet fund redemptions or margin calls. Liquidity in core funding markets could deteriorate if volatility caused hedge funds to step away from these markets or to quickly reduce leverage. This risk is exacerbated by the increasingly large presence of hedge funds in sovereign bond markets, including in the Government of Canada securities and repurchase (repo) markets.</p>
<p>Banks could also cut back on their intermediation services to protect their balance sheets—further disrupting the supply of liquidity when market participants need it most.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h3>The Bank will closely monitor a range of risks to financial stability</h3>
<p>As the trade war unfolds, the Bank will be closely watching the risks around debt serviceability and market functioning. The main near-term concern is the risk of a disorderly market sell-off. Over time, the risks to household and business income, and by extension to banks, could grow if the economic impacts of the trade war were to increase. Interconnections in the financial system could amplify the impacts if risks were to materialize (<a href="#box2">Box&nbsp;2</a>).</p>
<p>As the policies of the US administration disrupt global trade, they could also reshape the international financial and monetary system. There are signs that investors have been rebalancing some of their exposure away from US assets toward other markets. At this stage, it is not clear whether this is a short-lived adjustment or a process that will build and gain momentum over time. Such adjustments could lead to sharp increases in the risk premium that investors require to hold US assets. Drastic shifts in global financial flows have the potential to disrupt liquidity in core funding markets and cause stress across the global financial system.</p>
<p>In the current context, the Bank will closely monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indicators</strong><strong> of financial stress</strong>—such as delinquency rates for businesses and households, especially for consumer credit products</li>
<li><strong>Evidence of precautionary behaviour by financial system participants</strong>—such as borrowers drawing on lines of credit more than usual, many investors abruptly moving away from risky assets and leveraged positions, or banks building additional capacity to absorb losses</li>
<li><strong>Availability of credit</strong>—including the extent to which households and businesses can refinance existing borrowing or fund new credit, particularly for workers and firms in sectors heavily exposed to tariffs</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for funding and market liquidity</strong>—especially evidence of rapid or persistent deterioration in core funding markets such as government bond and repo markets</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bank will continue to work closely with federal and provincial financial authorities to monitor and assess the health of Canada’s financial system and to address potential emerging issues. The objective is to foster a stable and resilient financial system that absorbs shocks and can support the economy through periods of turbulence.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h2>Households</h2>
<p>Many households continue to adjust to the higher debt-servicing costs that were a key concern in the previous Report. Mortgage holders have proved resilient in the face of higher payments. Signs of financial stress have increased over the past 12&nbsp;months but remain concentrated among households without a mortgage.</p>
<p>While interest rates have come down significantly over the past year, previous increases in interest rates are still affecting mortgage renewals. A large share of mortgages being renewed this year or next were taken out during the pandemic at historically low interest rates. Despite rates being much lower than they were 12&nbsp;months ago, most of these households will still see payment increases when they renew.</p>
<p>In past Reports, the Bank has regularly highlighted the vulnerability in the financial system created by high household indebtedness. While indebtedness remains elevated, it has come down over the past 12&nbsp;months—the ratio of household debt to disposable income has declined from 179% to 173%. With interest rates lower now than a year ago, the Bank is less concerned than it was about the impact of high borrowing costs on debt serviceability.</p>
<p>However, the trade war is threatening jobs and incomes, particularly in trade-dependent industries. Some affected households may become unable to continue making debt payments. In turn, this could lead to credit losses at banks (see <a href="#if1">In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability</a>).</p>
<h3>Signs of financial stress remain concentrated among households without a mortgage</h3>
<p>Since the previous Report, rates of arrears on credit cards and auto loans have risen further for households without a mortgage (<a href="#chart1">Chart&nbsp;1</a>). After falling to historically low levels during the pandemic, these arrears rates are now back above their historical levels.</p>
<p>For households with a mortgage, rates of arrears on consumer credit products have also risen over the past 12&nbsp;months but remain below historical averages.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h3>Lower interest rates are easing the pressure on mortgage holders</h3>
<p>About 60% of all outstanding mortgages in Canada will renew in 2025 or 2026. Based on current market expectations for interest rates, approximately 60% of mortgages in this group will see an increase in their payments at renewal. Most of the mortgages expected to see an increase in payments at renewal are five-year fixed-rate mortgages that were originated or renewed during the pandemic at record-low interest rates. However, given the sharp decline in interest rates over the past year, the average expected increase will be smaller than what market expectations for interest rates a year ago suggested (<a href="#chart2">Chart&nbsp;2).</a>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h3>Most mortgage holders are well positioned to manage higher payments</h3>
<p>Mortgages that originated during the pandemic had to qualify under a mortgage stress test to show that borrowers could handle payments under higher interest rates.<a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2" title="For a discussion of mortgage stress tests and their impact on household resilience, see J.&nbsp;Hartley and N.&nbsp;Paixão, “Mortgage stress tests and household financial resilience under monetary policy tightening,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No.&nbsp;2024-25 (November&nbsp;2024)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">2</a> Based on current market expectations, more than 90% of mortgage holders with a five-year fixed-rate mortgage will face payment increases at renewal that are smaller than they were stress-tested for. This implies their budgets should already have room to accommodate higher mortgage payments.</p>
<p>In addition, most households renewing their mortgage will have seen their income grow, and many have enough financial assets to fund higher payments for at least a year.<a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3" title="For example, Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey shows the average weekly wage rate of paid employees in Canada grew 24.8% between 2019 and 2024." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">3</a><sup>,</sup> <a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4" title="Analysis using data from the Canadian Financial Monitor suggests that 85% of mortgage holders renewing in 2025 and 2026 could cover their expected payment increases for 12&nbsp;months or more using current financial assets." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">4</a> Most homeowners have also seen their home equity boosted by increases in house prices. At the same time, the use of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) has been declining, implying additional capacity to borrow against home equity, if needed.<a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5" title="The average loan-to-value ratio for homeowners has declined from 74% at the end of 2019 to 71% at the end of 2024. Similarly, the average utilization rate of HELOCs has dropped from 35% at the end of 2019 to 28% at the end of 2024." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">5</a> Higher levels of equity provide a buffer for mortgage holders who are renewing and choose to refinance to manage their payments.</p>
<p>Taken together, these factors suggest that most households will be able to absorb higher payments as their mortgages renew. But this does not mean it will be easy. Many households will have to adjust their spending to manage higher payments. And some may have trouble keeping up with payments on other debt.</p>
<p>Moreover, the trade war poses risks to employment and income, particularly in industries that depend on trade. Some affected households may find it difficult to manage their debt payments.</p>
<h2>Non-financial businesses</h2>
<p>Non-financial businesses adjusted well to past interest-rate increases and have generally remained in solid financial health over the past 12 months. Larger firms have been supported by their diversified sources of funding and by the fact that most have long-term financing in place. Last year’s surge in insolvency filings by small businesses proved temporary, as anticipated.</p>
<p>The trade war will test the financial resilience of businesses in industries tied to trade. Those with existing vulnerabilities—high leverage, weak profitability and low cash reserves—are at risk of falling behind on debt payments, which could lead to losses for both banks and investors (see <a href="#if1">In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability</a>).</p>
</div>
			</div>
			<div class="cfct-module cfct-widget-module-bochtml new-page">
				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h3>Non-financial businesses remain in good financial health</h3>
<p>Among non-financial businesses, the ratio of total debt to assets has remained broadly stable since mid-2023 at relatively low levels (<a href="#chart3">Chart&nbsp;3</a>). The liquidity position of these businesses—measured by the ratio of total cash to debt—has deteriorated over the past 12&nbsp;months but remains robust by historical standards.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>Large businesses have generally avoided the immediate impacts of past increases in interest rates because they tend to use long-term sources of financing. About half of the outstanding debt of publicly listed Canadian businesses will not mature until at least 2030. Until the sharp increase in market volatility in early April, the issuance of new debt was strong, and the cost of financing remained low. Since then, issuance has diminished, and spreads between Canadian corporate and government bond yields have widened, returning close to historical averages.</p>
<h3>The surge in small-business insolvencies last year proved temporary</h3>
<p>Business insolvencies started to pick up in late 2023 (<a href="#chart4">Chart&nbsp;4</a>). The Bank’s analysis in the 2024 Report suggested that the surge would likely be temporary—the result of a delay in insolvency filings from mostly small businesses after pandemic-era government support programs ended.<a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6" title="Insolvency data reveal that the median liabilities held by businesses at the time of filing were close to $210,000 in 2023. Note that summary statistics calculated using the publicly available dataset from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy must be interpreted with some caution. This is because data on liabilities reflect what is reported as part of the filing by insolvency trustees, which need to report only $1,000 in liabilities to start the insolvency process. Since 2013, submissions that reported the minimum liabilities represented under 4% of all business insolvency filings. Also, data on liabilities are totalled by the first three digits of postal codes in the dataset." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">6</a> Business insolvencies have dropped significantly over the past 12&nbsp;months, which largely aligns with the Bank’s previous analysis.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h2>Banks</h2>
<p>Canadian banks remain well positioned to support the financial system and the broader economy, even through a period of financial stress. They have good access to funding through deposits and wholesale markets, and credit performance has been strong. They have increased their accumulated provisions—funds set aside for anticipated loan losses—and they maintain elevated levels of capital to absorb unexpected losses. They also continue to hold sufficient liquidity to meet their short-term obligations.</p>
<p>Prolonged and heightened financial stress on households and businesses would eventually spread to banks through higher credit losses. Banks could pull back on lending if losses affected their earnings and, at the extreme, their level of capital. That would add further stress on the economy and challenge overall financial stability (see <a href="#if1">In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability</a>).</p>
<h3>Canadian banks maintain good access to funding</h3>
<p>Banks have two main sources of funding: customer deposits and funds borrowed through wholesale capital markets. Both have remained readily available over the past 12&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Bank deposits have continued to grow. Deposits at large banks grew 10% from March&nbsp;2024 to March&nbsp;2025. Yet the composition of bank deposits has shifted. In 2022 and 2023, when interest rates were elevated, households and businesses tended to prefer term deposits over demand deposits. The higher interest rates also increased competition for deposits. As interest rates have come down, deposit growth has been gradually shifting away from term deposits and back to demand deposits.</p>
<p>Investor appetite for bank debt remained strong in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025; as a result, access to funding has been steady, and credit spreads for bank debt issued in wholesale markets have remained narrow (<a href="#chart5">Chart&nbsp;5</a>).</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>Compared with their larger counterparts, medium-sized banks have seen a bigger increase in loan impairments, including on business and mortgage loans. This largely reflects their different business models, which can be centred around mortgage lending to higher-risk borrowers and business lending concentrated in specific industries or regions. Medium-sized banks account for only a small fraction of total lending by Canadian banks. For example, the total loan portfolio of medium-sized banks is only about $150 billion, compared with more than $4.3&nbsp;trillion at large banks.</p>
<h3>Banks are well positioned to cope with a period of stress</h3>
<p>Banks’ balance sheets remain robust. If banks start to face financial pressure due to the economic effects of the trade war, they have ways to manage that pressure.</p>
<p>Their first line of defence against rising loan impairments is their accumulated provisions. At large banks, this amount is 8% higher than it was one year ago and 26% higher than two years ago. For medium-sized banks, accumulated provisions are 21% higher than one year ago and about 38% higher than two years ago.</p>
<p>In the event of large credit losses that go beyond what they anticipate and provision for, banks rely on capital to absorb losses. Large banks have increased their capital levels in recent years; their common equity Tier 1 capital ratio averaged 13.3% in the first quarter of 2025, about 2&nbsp;percentage points higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019.<a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7" title="The common equity Tier&nbsp;1 ratio is the highest quality of regulatory capital because it absorbs losses immediately when they occur. In this ratio, the numerator includes the sum of common shares and stock surplus, retained earnings, other comprehensive income, qualifying minority interest and regulatory adjustments. The denominator is risk-weighted assets." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">7</a> This rise is partly due to past tightening of regulatory requirements.<a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8" title="For example, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions raised the domestic stability buffer in 2022 and 2023 and has since maintained it at 3.5%, which is near the top of the range of 0% to 4%." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">8</a></p>
<p>Stress-testing exercises also show that the capital ratios of large banks would remain well above regulatory minimums, even during a period of severe stress (see <a href="#box1">Box&nbsp;1</a>).</p>
<p>Banks are also required to hold adequate levels of liquidity to meet their financial obligations, including through periods of stress such as high levels of deposit outflows or challenges accessing wholesale funding in a timely manner. Large banks continue to have sufficient liquid assets on hand to manage these risks. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks was 133% in the fourth quarter of 2024, higher than the regulatory minimum.<a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9" title="The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is defined as the stock of high-quality liquid assets that enables a bank to survive a 30-day stress scenario. The standard requires that the LCR be no lower than 100% in normal conditions." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">9</a> Medium-sized banks also carry elevated levels of liquid assets, with an average liquidity coverage ratio over 200%.</p>

<p id="box1"><span class="bocss-box-header">Box 1: Stress testing the resilience of large Canadian banks</span></p>
<p>In 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is reviewing Canada’s financial system under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). One element of this assessment involves stress-testing major banks to evaluate their resilience in the face of a severe shock, such as a trade war, that could cause stagflation—a situation that involves a combination of an economic downturn with high unemployment and high inflation.</p>
<p>The IMF and the Bank of Canada collaborated on this stress-testing exercise. The IMF provided the FSAP risk scenario, and the Bank analyzed the impact of the scenario on banks’ capital positions using its Top-Down Solvency Assessment tool.<a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10" title="In parallel, the IMF used its own stress-testing tools to evaluate the solvency of large Canadian banks and one credit union under the FSAP risk scenario. Results from the IMF exercise will be published in July&nbsp;2025." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">10</a><sup>,</sup> <a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11" title="The Top-Down Solvency Assessment tool is described briefly in A.&nbsp;Danaee, H.&nbsp;Grewal, B.&nbsp;Howell, G.&nbsp;Ouellet Leblanc, X.&nbsp;Liu, M.&nbsp;Patel and X.&nbsp;Shen, “How well can large banks in Canada withstand a severe economic downturn?” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No.&nbsp;2022-6 (May&nbsp;2022).

<p>The risk scenario incorporates geo-economic fragmentation, supply-chain disruptions and a significant correction in equity and house prices. This leads to a sharp contraction in real gross domestic product of approximately 5% and a spike in the unemployment rate beyond 9% (<a href="#table1a">Table&nbsp;1‑A</a>). The severe recession is assumed to last seven quarters—longer than previous historical episodes and longer than the four-quarter recession in Scenario&nbsp;2 presented in the Bank’s April&nbsp;2025 <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-04-16/"><em>Monetary Policy Report</em></a>.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h2>Non-bank financial intermediaries</h2>
<p>Non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) are a diverse set of entities that includes broker-dealers, finance companies and asset managers such as investment funds and pension funds. These entities play an increasingly important role in global markets and represent a greater share of the Canadian financial system than banks.</p>
<p>As the activities of NBFIs have evolved, so have the risks associated with them. In recent years, some asset managers have taken on higher levels of leverage—borrowed money—in Canada, leaving them vulnerable to sudden demands for liquidity, such as through margin calls. Much of this leverage is provided by bank-owned broker-dealers. Through this and other channels, NBFIs have become more interconnected with banks in ways that could make it easier for stress to spread throughout the financial system (<a href="#box2">Box&nbsp;2</a>).</p>
<p>Canadian and foreign-based hedge funds have become increasingly active participants in Canadian government bond and repo markets. A shock that leads hedge funds to suddenly withdraw from these markets could amplify financial stress, as seen in US bond markets in early April (<a href="#box3">Box&nbsp;3</a>). The trade war and the uncertainty it causes increase the risk of even more frequent and severe shocks in the future (see <a href="#if1">In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability</a>).</p>
<h3>Hedge funds have taken on a greater role in Government of Canada bond markets</h3>
<p>Bond market intermediaries support liquidity by buying bonds at the time of issuance and then facilitating the buying and selling of these securities in the secondary market. Historically, bank-owned broker-dealers have played that role in the Government of Canada (GoC) bond market. But because the total stock of GoC bonds has grown considerably since 2020, so has the amount being issued and traded. This has stretched dealers’ capacity to intermediate, which is limited by factors such as financial regulations and their own risk management practices.<a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14" title="Similar trends have been observed in other jurisdictions, including the United States." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">14</a></p>
<p>Hedge funds have taken on a larger role in these markets than in the past. In GoC debt auctions, hedge funds now buy almost 50% of the auction volume in some tenors (<a href="#chart7">Chart&nbsp;7</a>).<a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15" title="See A.&nbsp;Epp and J.&nbsp;Gao, “Are Hedge Funds a Hedge for Increasing Government Debt Issuance?” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2025-7 (May&nbsp;2025)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">15</a> They also represent about 30% of the volume of trades between dealers and clients in the secondary market for GoC bonds.<a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16" title="See J.&nbsp;Sandhu and R.&nbsp;Vala, “Do hedge funds support liquidity in the Government of Canada bond market?” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No.&nbsp;2023-11 (August&nbsp;2023)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">16</a> This is mainly due to the widespread use of leveraged strategies, such as the cash-futures basis trade (see <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2024/05/financial-stability-report-2024/#Box-3-Cashfutures-basis-trade">Box&nbsp;3</a> in the 2024 <em>Financial Stability Report</em> for more details).</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>Hedge funds’ increased participation in government debt auctions helps the market absorb the elevated level of debt issuance at competitive prices. And their active trading strategies add to the liquidity and efficiency of bond and futures markets.</p>
<p>However, hedge funds tend to finance their investments with leverage and do not face the same contractual obligations and regulatory requirements as bank dealers (e.g., minimum bidding obligations at auctions).<a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17" title="For example, see the Bank of Canada’s “Standard Terms for Auctions of Government of Canada Securities.”" aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">17</a> They may be more likely than bank dealers to pull back from these markets in certain situations. In a period of stress, hedge funds could find it harder to maintain their positions in GoC markets if, for example, they lost access to repo funding or if higher volatility in bond markets led to big margin calls. Foreign-based funds could also decide to abruptly reduce their exposure to GoC markets if trading in them became less attractive or riskier than trading in other markets—for example, due to an increase in funding costs or a sharp rise in volatility.</p>
<p>Further, hedge funds typically borrow money from bank dealers to finance their investment positions, such as through repo transactions or prime brokerage arrangements.<a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18" title="Prime brokerage is a set of services offered by a financial institution to institutional clients or hedge funds. It includes execution of trades, settlement, financing and custodial services." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">18</a> If bank dealers cut back on lending in a period of stress—because of higher costs, capital constraints or risk management considerations—that could limit the ability of hedge funds to trade. Some funds might even have to unwind their positions.<a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19" title="See Sandhu and Vala (2023)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">19</a> Abrupt sales of bonds could, in turn, strain market liquidity and create conditions for a dash for cash, as was seen at the onset of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Government bonds play many important roles in modern financial systems. Market participants use government bond prices as the benchmark for pricing other securities and loans. As well, participants regularly use these bonds as collateral in other core funding markets and in a range of financial contracts. Therefore, markets for government bonds must function properly for other markets to work well. A shock that leads to a rapid unwinding of positions involving government bonds could lead to market dysfunction and have adverse consequences for overall financial stability (<a href="#box3">Box&nbsp;3</a>).</p>
<h3>Asset managers are using more leverage but also boosting their liquidity</h3>
<p>Hedge funds and other asset managers—such as large pension funds—use leverage to enhance returns and manage risk. In periods of heightened volatility, this leverage can make asset managers more vulnerable to sudden liquidity needs because large price swings can lead to margin calls. These asset managers get much of their leverage through repo funding from banks. The use of this repo funding has increased significantly in the past five years, with asset managers’ total leverage through repo borrowing having grown by around 65% since 2020. Indeed, since the previous Report, the value of Canadian-dollar repo funding provided by banks has remained elevated (<a href="#chart8">Chart&nbsp;8</a>).<a href="#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20" title="Repo leverage is used here as a proxy for overall leverage." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">20</a> Since the 2024 Report, transaction data show that pension funds and hedge funds were the largest recipients of additional repo funding, with estimated increases of $18&nbsp;billion and $14&nbsp;billion, respectively.<a href="#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21" title="These estimates were calculated using data from the Market Trade Reporting System." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">21</a></p>

Hedge funds typically carry a higher degree of leverage, and about 70% of their overall repo leverage has a maturity of less than a week. In contrast, 40% of pension fund repo leverage has a maturity of more than a month.</p>
<p>Asset managers are generally sophisticated users of leverage and have robust liquidity management practices. For example, large pension funds use liquidity coverage ratios to monitor planned and potential outflows.<a href="#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22" title="See G.&nbsp;Bédard-Pagé, D.&nbsp;Bolduc-Zuluaga, A.&nbsp;Demers, J.-P.&nbsp;Dion, M.&nbsp;Pandey, L.&nbsp;Berger-Soucy and A.&nbsp;Walton, “COVID‑19 crisis: Liquidity management at Canada’s largest public pension funds,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No.&nbsp;2021-11 (May&nbsp;2021)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">22</a> Hedge funds typically use scenario analysis frameworks along with risk and leverage limits. Nonetheless, even sophisticated users can run into difficulties during periods of market stress, and the actions of individual participants can have repercussions for others in the financial system. The dash for cash in March 2020 is one example.<a href="#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23" title="See J.-S.&nbsp;Fontaine, C.&nbsp;Garriott, J.&nbsp;Johal, J.&nbsp;Lee and A.&nbsp;Uthemann, “COVID‑19 Crisis: Lessons Learned for Future Policy Research,” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No.&nbsp;2021-2 (February&nbsp;2021)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">23</a></p>
<p>As hedge funds take on a growing role in government bond markets, it is increasingly important for them to have robust funding agreements and sufficient liquidity to weather periods of market stress. The Bank will continue to monitor conditions for markets and market liquidity as well as the use of leverage by NBFIs. The Bank will also assess the impact of the growing involvement of NBFIs in Canadian bond markets.</p>

<p>Compared with banks, non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) are a more diverse set of entities. These entities include investment funds and other asset managers—which together hold the majority of NBFI assets—as well as other entities such as finance companies and broker-dealers. NBFIs collectively represent a greater share of the Canadian financial system than banks, holding $12.8&nbsp;trillion of assets at the end of 2023 compared with $7.4&nbsp;trillion for banks.<a href="#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24" title="NBFIs also represent a greater share of the global financial system than banks under the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) broad measure of the size of the NBFI sector.

In contrast, the Bank of Canada’s measure—which excludes certain entities such as mixed investment funds but includes repos—stood at $1.9&nbsp;trillion in the same period. For the Bank’s definition of NBFIs, see A.&nbsp;Arora, G.&nbsp;Bédard-Pagé,&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Besnier,&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Ford and A.&nbsp;Walsh, “Non-bank financial intermediation in Canada: a pulse check,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No.&nbsp;2021-2 (March&nbsp;2021)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">25</a></p>
<p>While banks and NBFIs are often competitors, they also work together: a bank might provide funding to a financing company and an investment fund might buy securities issued by a bank.</p>
<p>Connections between banks and NBFIs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct exposures</strong>—such as securities financing transactions (<a href="#chart2a">Chart&nbsp;2-A</a>) and credit lines (<a href="#chart2b">Chart&nbsp;2-B</a>).<a href="#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26" title="Securities financing transactions are transactions that exchange securities, such as bonds or equities, for cash or other securities. They include repos and securities lending transactions." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">26</a> Canadian NBFIs provide about $200&nbsp;billion in funding to Canadian banks, largely through deposits and repo funding, and hold an estimated $200&nbsp;billion to $250&nbsp;billion in long-term debt securities issued by Canadian banks. Canadian banks also have international direct exposures to NBFIs.<a href="#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27" title="See C.&nbsp;Friedrich, H.&nbsp;Friedrich, N.&nbsp;Lawrence, J.&nbsp;Cortes Orihuela and P.&nbsp;Tian, “The International Exposure of the Canadian Banking System,” Bank of Canada Staff Working Paper No.&nbsp;2025-1 (January&nbsp;2025)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">27</a></li>
<li><strong>Common exposures</strong>—to various securities, derivatives and core funding markets. Banks and NBFIs can be affected by changes in pricing or liquidity for these instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Common ownership</strong>—bank-owned broker-dealers represent more than 95% of broker-dealer assets in Canada.</li>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>These connections are an inherent feature of the financial system and help make it more efficient. But they can also amplify and spread stress. As the NBFI sector grows, its demands for liquidity could exceed what banks are able to provide, particularly during a stress event. In extreme cases, many firms could seek liquidity at the same time and fuel a broad dash for cash. Canadian banks’ international exposures mean that they could also be exposed to liquidity strains across borders.</p>
<p>Canadian banks operate in a highly regulated environment, giving the Bank access to frequent and high-quality data on their exposures and activities. Quality data are not readily available for all NBFIs because some are not subject to the same level of regulatory reporting and disclosure, making it more challenging to analyze and monitor them. Given the increasing role of NBFIs in Canada’s financial system and the growing connections to Canada’s banking sector, the Bank is gathering additional data to improve its ability to analyze and monitor risks. This includes identifying and assessing connections across entities and borders as well as understanding how banks decide to lend or intermediate during periods of stress.</p>

<p id="box3"><span class="bocss-box-header">Box 3: Recent developments in swap spreads</span></p>
<p>Following the US tariff announcements in early April 2025, financial markets around the world saw a significant rise in volatility. Few of these movements caused as much concern and speculation as the sudden sharp rise in US Treasury yields. US Treasuries have traditionally played key roles in the global financial system as a benchmark for pricing other securities and as a safe-haven asset—meaning their prices rise and their yields typically fall during periods of market stress. The unusual rise in yields in April may have been partially driven by an unwinding of leveraged bets that US swap spreads would start to increase after having declined over the past few years.</p>
<p>Swap spreads are the difference in yield between an interest rate swap and a government bond of the same maturity.<a href="#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28" title="An interest rate swap is a derivative contract in which one party pays (receives) a fixed rate against receiving (paying) a floating rate for an agreed term." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">28</a> The size of the spread is influenced by the supply of government bonds, regulatory constraints, the cost of funding and other technical factors. In recent years, swap spreads have faced downward pressure from a combination of growing supplies of government bonds and regulatory changes since the 2008–09 global financial crisis. As a result, spreads in Canada and the United States have declined in recent years to negative levels (<a href="#chart3a">Chart&nbsp;3-A</a>). Negative swap spreads are a sign that market participants are demanding a higher rate of return on government bonds than the rates of return on other fixed-income products, namely interest rate swaps.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>After the US election in November 2024, market participants speculated that the new administration might change banking regulations in the United States in a way that would reduce the cost to banks and dealers of holding additional government bonds on their balance sheets. Feedback from market participants suggests that hedge funds, after they saw potential shifts in the factors that determine swap spreads, began to expect that swap spreads would increase. Because of this, hedge funds started buying US Treasury bonds and paying the fixed interest rate in an equivalent maturity interest rate swap. That is, they went long on swap spreads.</p>
<p>Some of these bets may have been unwound quickly following the US tariff announcements on April&nbsp;2: a sharp sell-off in longer-dated US Treasuries caused longer-dated swap spreads to decline. The unwinding of long swap spread positions—which involved selling US Treasuries and receiving a fixed interest rate on interest rate swaps—may have amplified the steep decline in swap spreads due to poor market liquidity at the time. Other sovereign debt markets, including Canada, saw smaller moves than in the United States.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h2 id="if1">In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability</h2>
<p>Since the change in the US administration in January&nbsp;2025, US trade policy has been highly volatile and unpredictable, with announcements about the timing, scope and magnitude of trade tariffs being continuously revised.</p>
<p>As outlined in Scenario&nbsp;2 of the Bank of Canada’s April&nbsp;2025 <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-04-16/"><em>Monetary Policy Report</em></a> (MPR), a prolonged global trade war would be highly disruptive for the Canadian economy. The MPR scenario is not a forecast; rather, the scenario is designed to illustrate the channels through which permanent tariffs could impact the Canadian economy. In this scenario, Canada experiences a year-long recession, elevated unemployment and inflation that rises temporarily above 3%. The MPR also acknowledged the presence of further downside risks from weaker demand for Canadian exports and possible financial stress.</p>
<p>A severe and long-lasting trade war could test the financial system’s resilience through two key risk channels (<a href="#figure1">Figure&nbsp;1</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>significant credit defaults among borrowers (<span style="color: #844356;"><strong>debt-serviceability risk</strong></span>)</li>
<li>substantial liquidity draws for asset managers (<span style="color: #4b2965;"><strong>liquidity risk</strong></span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This section describes how these risk channels could amplify a downturn and test financial stability.</p>

		  <p class="bocss-padding-top-large">Figure 1 shows two key risk channels through which a severe and long-lasting trade war could affect financial stability. These are debt-serviceability risk and liquidity risk.</p>
<strong>Debt-serviceability risk channels</strong>
<p>Under a severe and long-lasting trade war, non-financial businesses exposed to US trade would face lower sales and higher input costs. Some of the affected businesses could default on their debt or lay off some workers. In turn, some of the laid-off workers could also default on their debt. These credit defaults could lead to losses for banks.</p>
<strong>Liquidity risk channels</strong>
<p>Under a severe and long-lasting trade war, financial assets could undergo an abrupt repricing, which would negatively affect investors and financial markets. In addition, asset managers could face margin calls or redemptions from investors. Some asset managers could turn to banks for more liquidity.</p>
<strong>Amplifications </strong>
<p>These two risk channels could amplify an economic downturn. Banks that face increased defaults from borrowers and higher demand for liquidity by asset managers could take defensive measures to protect their capital ratios. For example, they could reduce lending to households and non-financial businesses or reduce their intermediation activity.</p>
<p>These defensive measures would amplify the impact of the trade war on the economy and the financial system.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h3>Many businesses would face financial difficulties</h3>
<p>Large permanent tariffs would lower Canadian economic activity and income. Businesses exposed to US trade would face lower demand for their products and higher input costs. This would lead to lower profits. Affected businesses may seek additional credit from financial markets or banks—for example, by drawing on existing lines of credit. Some may default on their debt, generating credit losses for banks. Over time, as resources are reallocated to adapt to the new business environment, some assets may become unsuited to the new conditions and become outdated or unnecessary.</p>
<p>Businesses that export a large share of their production to the United States and have high leverage, low profitability and low cash reserves are particularly vulnerable to a long-lasting trade war.<a href="#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29" title="To estimate the probabilities of insolvency plotted in Chart&nbsp;9, Bank staff used a logit model to predict the risk of insolvency at the firm level using lagged financial metrics on leverage, profit margins and liquidity.

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>Businesses in domestic-focused industries may not see a direct impact from tariffs in the early stages of the trade war. But with time, they too would likely suffer from the large drop in overall demand. Because these industries account for the bulk of non-financial corporate debt in Canada, the investors and banks that finance them could see losses if these businesses cannot service their debt.</p>
<p>In a prolonged trade war, existing and new government support programs would likely help businesses and the economy adjust. Governments have already announced some measures to support businesses affected by the tariffs, such as tariff relief or loan facilities.<a href="#footnote-30" id="footnote-ref-30" title="See, for example, Department of Finance Canada, “Canada announces new support for Canadian businesses affected by U.S. tariffs,” press release (April&nbsp;15, 2025); Business Development Bank of Canada, “BDC brings $500M in new financing, advisory services, and strategic insights to help businesses pivot and mitigate the impacts of uncertainty around US tariffs,” press release (March&nbsp;7, 2025); and Export Development Canada, “Export Development Canada ready to support Canadian exporters impacted by market uncertainty,” press release (March&nbsp;7, 2025)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">30</a></p>
<h3>Many households would struggle to pay their debt after layoffs</h3>
<p>Even with government support, some businesses affected by the trade war may lay off workers as they adjust to lower demand. Faced with a large reduction in income, some of the people who lose their job could have trouble paying their debt.</p>
<p>To better understand how a long-lasting trade war could affect households’ ability to service their mortgage, Bank staff simulated a profile of mortgage arrears under Scenario&nbsp;2 in the April&nbsp;2025 MPR (<a href="#chart10">Chart&nbsp;10</a>).<a href="#footnote-31" id="footnote-ref-31" title="To map macroeconomic scenarios to the rates of mortgage arrears, Bank staff estimated a regression equation over the period from 1989 to 2019. Specifically, staff regressed the rate of mortgage arrears onto past unemployment rates and many other explanatory control variables (i.e., the job separation and finding rates, changes in house prices, mortgage interest rates, core inflation and the output gap)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">31</a> The projected increase in mortgage arrears is displayed as a range to show how amplification channels—such as large increases in unemployment or large declines in house prices—could interact, making it difficult to estimate precisely how such a scenario would unfold.<a href="#footnote-32" id="footnote-ref-32" title="In previous recessions in Canada, the economic downturn had a greater impact than expected on both unemployment and houses prices." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">32</a> Results suggest that the share of mortgages in arrears by at least 90 days could rise to a level comparable with or higher than levels reached in the 2008–09 global financial crisis.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h3>Banks may experience large credit losses, which could affect their ability to support the economy</h3>
<p>To assess banks’ potential exposure to credit defaults by businesses and households, Bank staff analyzed the balance sheets of Canadian banks.</p>
<p>In general, loans to households or businesses in trade-sensitive industries or regions represent around 15% of the assets of banks in Canada. The balance consists of loans and other assets that have a low direct exposure to trade. Nonetheless, a trade war that generates a marked economic slowdown or recession could still indirectly affect these domestic industries.</p>
<p>Although the direct exposure to trade is similar between large banks and small and medium-sized banks, the composition of their loan book is different. Small and medium-sized banks tend to have a more pronounced focus on mortgage lending. They are also often regionally concentrated, which, in some cases, could imply higher exposure to trade-sensitive industries.</p>
<p>Stress tests indicate banks would remain resilient even in a severe economic downturn (<a href="#box1">Box&nbsp;1</a>). Their strong balance sheets would allow banks to keep lending through stress, supporting the economy. But substantial credit losses could still lead them to take defensive measures to protect their capital ratios.</p>
<p>For example, banks could reduce the availability of credit or tighten lending standards, particularly for borrowers who are already financially fragile or operate in sectors most exposed to the trade war. This could spread stress throughout the financial system—potentially amplifying the economic downturn.</p>
<h3>A sudden change in market sentiment could spur demand for liquidity</h3>
<p>The potential for a more severe or long-lasting trade war has made investors increasingly uncertain about the future economic outlook. However, even as markets have grown more volatile, the risk premiums demanded by investors in equity markets have remained below their longer-term averages. A new escalation of the trade war or a growing belief that tariffs might be permanent could further reduce investor appetite for risk and lead to another, potentially disorderly sell-off of risky assets.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a market-wide shock, participants across the financial system could seek liquidity at the same time. Many households and businesses may want to use their credit lines with banks. Asset managers may seek to raise cash to cover actual or anticipated margin calls or investor redemptions. And to protect their balance sheets, banks may build up larger liquidity buffers to avoid the risk of not meeting their obligations. Combined, these actions could lead to asset fire sales and price spirals. This could precipitate market dysfunction in core funding markets, affecting all market participants that rely on them. At the extreme, authorities might need to provide liquidity to restore market functioning.</p>
