							Preliminary estimates for November indicate that the index increased by 0.6&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (on a
							monthly average basis) in SDR terms, after increasing by 3.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in October (revised).
							The non-rural subindex increased in the month, while the rural and base metal subindices
							both declined. In Australian dollar terms, the index increased by 2.0&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in November.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the past year, the index has decreased by 11.8&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in SDR terms, led by lower iron
							ore and coking coal prices. The index has decreased by 12.6&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in Australian dollar
							terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Consistent with previous releases, preliminary estimates for iron ore, coking coal, thermal
							coal and LNG export prices are being used for the most recent months, based on market
							information. Using spot prices for the bulk commodities index, the index decreased by 0.1
							per cent in November in SDR terms, to be 10.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent lower over the past year.
