The Reserve Bank of Australia welcomes the appointment of new members to the Governance Board and Monetary Policy Board.

In particular I extend my gratitude to Carol Schwartz AO and Elana Rubin AM for their invaluable contributions to the Reserve Bank Board and thank them for their dedication and willingness to ensure continuity on the Governance Board.

I also welcome the agreement of current members of the Reserve Bank Board to continue to serve on the Monetary Policy Board.

I am looking forward to working with Marnie Baker and Renee Fry-McKibbin. Their expertise and insights will be vital as we continue our efforts to bring inflation back to target.

The new members appointed to the Governance Board, Swati Dave, Danny Gilbert AM, David Thodey AO and Jennifer Westacott AO, will greatly assist the RBA in supporting and overseeing management as we continue to transform the organisation.
