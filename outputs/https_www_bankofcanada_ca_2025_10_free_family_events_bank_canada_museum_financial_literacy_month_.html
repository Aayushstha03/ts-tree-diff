            This November, the Bank of Canada Museum invites visitors to celebrate the 15<sup>th </sup>anniversary of
            Financial Literacy Month (FLM) with a full lineup of free, hands-on activities that make money management
            approachable, practical, and fun for all ages.

            Since its launch in 2011, Financial Literacy Month has been observed every November as a national initiative
            to strengthen Canadians’ knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing money. Led by the Financial Consumer
            Agency of Canada (FCAC), FLM brings together partners from across the country to help Canadians make
            informed financial decisions and build a stronger financial future.

            This year’s theme, “Let’s Talk Money,” encourages open conversations about money. At the Bank of Canada
            Museum, visitors will find a mix of playful activities for children, practical workshops for adults, and
            tailored offerings for teachers.
