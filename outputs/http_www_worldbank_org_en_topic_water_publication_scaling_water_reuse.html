        <h2><strong>Overview of the report</strong></h2><p><i>What if water had a second chance?</i></p><p>The World Bank Group’s new flagship report, <i>Scaling Water Reuse: A Tipping Point for Municipal and Industrial Use</i>, makes the case for investing in the treatment and reuse of water to create fit-for-purpose supply for municipal and industrial use, unlocking a valuable and sustainable source of new water.&nbsp;</p>

	<h2>Key Highlights:</h2>            
         <div><ul>   <li>Water reuse is a vital solution to growing water insecurity—offering a reliable, climate-resilient supply for cities and industries facing increasing stress on traditional water sources.</li>
           <li>While the potential for reuse is underutilized, it is at a tipping point. Enabled by targeted investment and enabling regulations, potable and industrial reuse could grow 8-fold by 2040, reaching 430 million cubic meters per day, the equivalent of one quarter of freshwater withdrawals for the municipal sector.</li>
           <li>Scaling reuse requires larger, programmatic investments and supportive regulatory frameworks, with the potential to unlock up to US$340 billion in potential investment by 2040, including private capital. The World Bank Group is supporting this transition through its Scaling ReWater initiative. As the experience from the solar and wind sectors, and desalination highlights, scaling capacity can reduce costs and promote greater standardization, while increasing private investment.</li>

        <p>Cities and industries generate nearly 1 billion cubic meters of used water each day, however, much of it is untreated and discharged into the environment. This resource can be captured and purified to reduce pressure on freshwater sources, lower pollution, and mobilize new sources of financing.&nbsp;</p><p>Although global reuse capacity has tripled over the past 20 years and is expanding at nearly 7% annually, total water reuse across all applications still accounts for only 12% of municipal freshwater withdrawals, and for potable and industrial reuse, just 3%.</p>

        <p>This report emphasizes the critical role of public policy, regulation, and funding in creating the enabling conditions needed to scale water reuse, while also mobilizing private sector participation and finance. The business case for reuse is strongest when wastewater is available close to the point of use, which tends to be the case for urban centers and industrial parks. Therefore, the core focus of the report is on the municipal and industrial sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>It also draws on global data and real-world examples to show how water reuse stands out as a financially sound and environmentally responsible approach when supported by enabling frameworks.</p> <img src="https://worldbank.scene7.com/is/image/worldbankprod/Data-2-Reuse?wid=780&amp;hei=439&amp;qlt=85,0&amp;resMode=sharp" alt="Scaling Reuse" title="" id="fig_3fda692969a449d0a8e72abd20ff5df5_1"><p>The report provides differentiated roadmaps for national and state governments, municipalities and utilities, and corporates and industries. Across these, several cross-cutting themes emerge that all actors can leverage to advance reuse:</p><ol><li><strong>The establishment of reuse ambitions and strategies</strong>, combined with integrated planning</li><li><strong>Support for programmatic approaches</strong>&nbsp;to drive scale and lower costs and risks</li><li><strong>Clear pricing signals and regulations</strong>&nbsp;to create the conditions for private sector participation</li><li><strong>The design of bankable investments</strong>&nbsp;through appropriate delivery models and financing instruments, including the efficient use of public funding</li></ol>
