This November, the Bank of Canada Museum invites visitors to celebrate the 15<sup>th </sup>anniversary of Financial Literacy Month (FLM) with a full lineup of free, hands-on activities that make money management approachable, practical, and fun for all ages. 
</p>

<p>
Since its launch in 2011, Financial Literacy Month has been observed every November as a national initiative to strengthen Canadians’ knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing money. Led by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC), FLM brings together partners from across the country to help Canadians make informed financial decisions and build a stronger financial future.

This year’s theme, “Let’s Talk Money,” encourages open conversations about money. At the Bank of Canada Museum, visitors will find a mix of playful activities for children, practical workshops for adults, and tailored offerings for teachers.
