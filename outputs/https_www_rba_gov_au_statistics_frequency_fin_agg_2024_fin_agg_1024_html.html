						<p>All growth rates for the financial aggregates are seasonally adjusted, and adjusted for the effects of
							breaks in the series as recorded in the notes to the tables listed below. Data for the levels of
							financial aggregates are not adjusted for series breaks, and growth rates should not be calculated from
							data on the levels of credit. Historical levels and growth rates for the financial aggregates have been
							revised owing to the resubmission of data by some financial intermediaries, the re-estimation of seasonal
							factors and the incorporation of securitisation data. The RBA credit aggregates measure credit provided
							by financial institutions operating domestically. They do not capture cross-border or non-intermediated
							lending.</p>
						<p>
	Since the July 2019 release, the financial aggregates have incorporated an improved
	conceptual framework and a new data collection. This is referred to as the Economic and
	Financial Statistics (EFS) collection. For more information, see
	<a href="/publications/bulletin/2019/mar/updates-to-australias-financial-aggregates.html">Updates to Australia’s Financial
	Aggregates</a> and the <a href="/statistics/frequency/fin-agg/2019/fin-agg-0719.html">July 2019 Financial Aggregates</a>.

	Since the March 2023 release, series that exclude lending to warehouse trusts in business credit were added to
	the financial aggregates. More information is available in the
	<a href="/statistics/tables/changes-to-tables.html#d20230421">Change Notice published 21 April 2023</a>.

	As usual, all growth rates for the financial aggregates are adjusted for the effects of
	breaks in the series as recorded in the notes to the tables listed below. Data for the
	levels of financial aggregates are not adjusted for series breaks. The RBA credit aggregates
	measure credit provided by financial institutions operating domestically. They do not
	capture cross-border or non-intermediated lending.
