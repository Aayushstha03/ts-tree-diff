            <!-- END ACCORDION SUMMARY-->
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests and colleagues,</p>
            <p>Welcome to the XIV edition of the 'Economics of Payments Conference'.<sup><a id="footnote-028-backlink"
                        role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-028">1</a></sup> It is a pleasure to host this prestigious
                gathering of policymakers, regulators, academics, and private sector professionals who are at the
                forefront of the evolution in payments. Banca d'Italia, in collaboration with the Committee on Payments
                and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), is pleased to welcome you for two days of rigorous dialogue,
                data-driven insights, and collaborative vision-setting. In a period marked by both profound uncertainty
                and unparalleled opportunities spurred by technological innovation, such dialogue is more essential than
                ever.</p>
            <p>This year, we are especially delighted to welcome Professor Fernando Alvarez, from the University of
                Chicago, and Miguel Díaz, Head of Strategy at the BIS Innovation Hub, as keynote speakers. The program
                features 27 papers across 7 themed sessions, showcasing perspectives from central banks, international
                institutions, academia, and fintech.</p>
            <p>Sessions span topics from the macroeconomics of digital currencies, payments, and payment choices to the
                granular realities of payment instrument adoption, cross-border payments and remittances,
                interoperability, and financial stability. Additional poster sessions will allow for deep dives into new
                data and methods for the study of retail payments and into the nuts and bolts of payment
                infrastructures.</p>
            <p>With its rich menu, the conference offers not only food for thought but hopefully some viable
                considerations for guiding practice and policy. The variety of topics in fact confirms the vivacity of
                payments in the current environment, which makes an integrated view comprising technical, academic, and
                policy perspectives crucial to support innovation that is secure, efficient, inclusive, and resilient.
            </p>
            <p>And it is hard to speak about payments innovation without mentioning the increased role played by the
                crypto-assets market and stablecoins. In the remainder of my remarks, I will thus focus on recent
                developments in the stablecoin market, an area that has attracted growing interest for its potential use
                cases but that continues to present relevant challenges.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, that is, stablecoins are often presented as promising tools for lowering transaction
                costs, enhancing efficiency, and enabling 24/7 availability.<sup><a id="footnote-027-backlink"
                        role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-027">2</a></sup> On the other hand, they carry inherent
                vulnerabilities such as run risk and interconnectedness, which could lead to financial stability
                concerns. Having discussed these risks in other venues,<sup><a id="footnote-026-backlink"
                        role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-026">3</a></sup> today I would like to focus on two open
                issues: regulatory fragmentation and multi-issuance models.</p>
            <h2>Market snapshot and recent developments</h2>
            <p>Stablecoins are digital tokens recorded on distributed ledgers ('on-chain') that aim to maintain a stable
                value relative to a reference asset, including fiat currency such as the US dollar or euro. In the case
                of fiat currency, stability is achieved by ensuring - or attempting to ensure - convertibility at par
                value, on demand. Unlike unbacked crypto-assets, such as Bitcoin or Ether, stablecoins are designed to
                be redeemable and anchored to external value reserves which are often, but not always, held in (the form
                of) liquid and low-risk assets.<sup><a id="footnote-025-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-025">4</a></sup></p>
            <p>As of last week, global crypto-asset capitalization exceeded 4 trillion US dollars. Stablecoins now
                represent nearly 300 billion dollars - about 7.5 per cent of the crypto market - marking a 75 per cent
                year-over-year growth.</p>
            <p>The sector remains heavily concentrated.<sup><a id="footnote-024-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-024">5</a></sup> Tether's USDT accounts for 56 per cent of the market; followed
                by Circle's USDC with 25 per cent.<sup><a id="footnote-023-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-023">6</a></sup> Together, these two US dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate 80
                per cent of the space. In total, stablecoins that aim to maintain parity with the USD make up 98 per
                cent of the global market.</p>
            <p>In stark contrast, euro-denominated stablecoins account for about 620 million dollars in market
                capitalization - about 0.2 per cent of the total. The largest are EURC (Circle) and EURS (Stasis),
                collectively holding 60 per cent of this subsegment.</p>
            <p>At present, stablecoin demand is spurred by four main drivers.<sup><a id="footnote-022-backlink"
                        role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-022">7</a></sup> First, stablecoins primarily serve as a
                transactional bridge for entering and exiting the crypto-asset ecosystem.<sup><a
                        id="footnote-021-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-021">8</a></sup> Their role is
                closely tied to enabling liquidity flows across trading platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi)
                protocols, where they function as readily transferable digital tokens.</p>
            <p>Second, in emerging markets plagued by inflation, currency volatility, and high remittance costs,
                stablecoins may offer an alternative to more traditional solutions to store value and transfer funds,
                such as those operated by banks and money transfer operators (MTOs).<sup><a id="footnote-020-backlink"
                        role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-020">9</a></sup></p>
            <p>Third, although retail adoption is still limited, many companies are testing stablecoin integrations for
                programmable B2B payments.<sup><a id="footnote-019-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-019">10</a></sup> Some stablecoins issuers have partnered with major payment
                networks to embed stablecoin use in settlement layers.</p>
            <p>Fourth driver is the potential for illicit activity - such as fraud, money laundering, and sanctions
                evasion - which can overlap with the other use cases and remains a significant concern. Stablecoins'
                ease of use, global accessibility, and the limited traceability of certain protocols make them
                particularly susceptible to misuse. Although accurately quantifying such activity remains
                challenging,<sup><a id="footnote-018-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-018">11</a></sup>
                these features underscore the need for strong regulatory oversight and effective monitoring mechanisms
                as their adoption grows.<sup><a id="footnote-017-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-017">12</a></sup></p>
            <p>A recent analysis has attempted to quantify the primary use of the existing stablecoins described
                above.<sup><a id="footnote-016-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-016">13</a></sup> According
                to this research, crypto trading activities represent the most important use case (about 90 per cent of
                volume) while payments use cases (cross-border remittances, corporate treasury and P2P) represent a
                small fraction (roughly 6 per cent). Whether stablecoins truly offer a faster and more cost-effective
                alternative to traditional payment channels (e.g. banks and remittance services) remains an open
                question. In this regard, it is worth noting that while various types of crypto products are used as a
                means of payment, only stablecoins pegged to a single fiat currency are suitable for this function, also
                because they offer a high level of customer protection through the right to redemption at their nominal
                value.<sup><a id="footnote-015-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-015">14</a></sup></p>
            <p>According to the World Bank, the average global cost to send a 200 USD remittance in 2024 stood at around
                6.5 per cent, with significant regional variation depending on provider, corridor and regulatory
                framework.<sup><a id="footnote-014-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-014">15</a></sup> Other
                sources<sup><a id="footnote-013-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-013">16</a></sup> estimated
                that using stablecoins to send a 200 USD remittance from sub-Saharan Africa reduces costs by
                approximately 60 per cent compared to traditional methods.<sup><a id="footnote-012-backlink"
                        role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-012">17</a></sup> And some market operators claim that
                stablecoins can enable low-cost settlement, with transaction fees often below 0.01 USD on certain Layer
                2 networks.<sup><a id="footnote-011-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-011">18</a></sup>
                However, these figures typically exclude critical components of the payment chain - such as 'last mile'
                delivery costs, on/off-ramp fees, and foreign exchange charges. As a result, the overall efficiency of
                stablecoins may be overstated, particularly when evaluated against the full end-to-end expense of
                cross-border payments.</p>
            <p>Focusing on the largest stablecoins (Circle and Tether) a recent analysis run by the IMF<sup><a
                        id="footnote-010-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-010">19</a></sup> confirms that
                Tether's USDT is more popular in regions with the most emerging economies - Africa and the Middle East,
                Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean -while Circle's USDC is more prevalent in
                regions with more advanced economies, i.e. Europe and North America.</p>
            <p>As to the use of euro-denominated stablecoins, while data remains rather limited, early evidence suggests
                that they are primarily exchanged against dollar-denominated stablecoins. Internal analyses<sup><a
                        id="footnote-009-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-009">20</a></sup> also indicate
                that the euro-dollar exchange rate may influence the market capitalization of euro-denominated
                stablecoins: periods of euro depreciation tend to coincide with increased demand for euro stablecoins,
                possibly reflecting European investors' search for positive returns during dollar appreciation.</p>
            <p>Traditional institutions are responding to shifting dynamics in the stablecoin market and to the growing
                use cases just described. Several banks in the US and Europe have announced plans to issue their own
                stablecoins, often citing client demand for more efficient digital payment solutions. Recent strategic
                alliances - involving large international banks and crypto-exchanges - aim to bridge the gap between
                fiat and crypto ecosystems. Meanwhile, some BigTech platforms are developing embedded stablecoin
                solutions.</p>
            <h2>Challenges and risks</h2>
            <p>As the financial system continues to evolve, stablecoins and other innovative instruments deserve our
                close attention. These instruments may offer novel solutions to long-standing issues in payments and
                financial intermediation, particularly in the cross-border context. However, their growth also raises
                important questions about governance, stability, their potential misuse for illicit purposes, and the
                consistency of oversight across jurisdictions.<sup><a id="footnote-008-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-008">21</a></sup> As we navigate this landscape, it is essential that we remain
                open to the opportunities presented by modern technologies, while carefully evaluating their potential
                impact on the broader financial system. Striking the right balance between enabling innovation and
                safeguarding key policy objectives - such as financial stability, monetary sovereignty, financial
                inclusion, consumer protection, and trust in money - remains a major challenge for public authorities.
            </p>
            <p>Today I would like to highlight two vulnerabilities that, in my view, are particularly relevant, not only
                because of their potential systemic impact, but also because of the specific institutional and
                regulatory context in which we operate.</p>
            <h3><em>Regulatory fragmentation</em></h3>
            <p>At an international level, several jurisdictions have either adopted or are finalizing dedicated
                regulatory frameworks for crypto-assets.<sup><a id="footnote-007-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-007">22</a></sup> While the institutional approaches may differ, they all share
                the same objective: to establish clear rules that enhance legal certainty, strengthen consumer
                protection, and safeguard market integrity. I will focus on a comparison between the European and
                American frameworks, sharing some preliminary thoughts with you.</p>
            <p>Both the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and the US Genius Act provide a regulatory
                regime for stablecoins, including licensing regimes, operational and compliance requirements, and
                restrictions on the composition of reserve assets for issuers. However, the two frameworks differ in
                important respects, particularly when it comes to scope, enforcement, and the degree of holders'
                protection.</p>
            <p>In terms of scope, the US framework is narrower, focusing specifically on payment stablecoins. By
                contrast, MiCAR applies to a much broader category of crypto-assets that are not already covered by
                existing financial regulation. In terms of enforcement, MiCAR introduces a robust supervisory framework
                for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), requiring authorization from national competent authorities
                and imposing detailed obligations regarding governance, capital, the segregation of client assets, and
                the conduct of business. The Genius Act takes a lighter-touch approach and currently leaves many service
                providers outside its scope.<sup><a id="footnote-006-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-006">23</a></sup> Regarding crisis management, MiCAR requires stablecoin issuers
                to draw and maintain recovery and resolution plans, whereas the Genius Act provides only limited tools.
            </p>
            <p>Another difference concerns redemption fees. MiCAR requires that stablecoin issuers guarantee the
                redemption of single-currency stablecoins at par without imposing fees, while the US rules allow for
                users to be charged for payment stablecoins.<sup><a id="footnote-005-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-005">24</a></sup></p>
            <p>In addition, unlike the Genius Act, MiCAR addresses issues of market abuse directly. In this sense, the
                European framework adopts a broader approach to investor protection and market integrity.</p>
            <p>Other jurisdictions are moving in different directions. For instance, in the United Kingdom, draft
                legislation published by the UK Treasury<sup><a id="footnote-004-backlink" role="doc-noteref"
                        href="#footnote-004">25</a></sup> proposes that only stablecoins issued from within the UK
                should be subject to regulatory oversight - those issued abroad could still be traded on UK exchanges.
                Meanwhile, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong have developed their own models. These divergences raise
                concerns about regulatory fragmentation and the potential for arbitrage, which could undermine
                supervisory coherence.</p>
            <p>This brings me to the second issue I would like to discuss today.</p>
            <h3><em>Multi-issuance stablecoins</em></h3>
            <p>Multi-issuance stablecoins (MISC) are tokens issued under a single brand by multiple entities operating
                in different jurisdictions. Those tokens are fully fungible, regardless of the issuer.<sup><a
                        id="footnote-003-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-003">26</a></sup> Under this
                scheme, EU stablecoin issuers could receive redemption requests from third-country token holders. If
                sufficient reserves are unavailable in the EU to meet these requests, the third-country entity is
                expected to transfer assets.</p>
            <p>Although this architecture could enhance global liquidity and scalability, it poses significant legal,
                operational, liquidity and financial stability risks at EU level, particularly if at least one issuer is
                located outside the European Union. In these cases, liquidity risk is heightened, as each co-issuer
                could be held liable for the entire outstanding token volume, even though they only hold a small
                fraction of the corresponding reserve assets, simply because holders, whether resident or non-resident,
                view all tokens as interchangeable. This can lead to a mismatch between obligations and available
                reserves, especially if redemptions are concentrated in the EU while reserves are held abroad or on the
                balance sheets of other issuers.</p>
            <p>Further complications arise from inter-issuer agreements, such as reserve rebalancing mechanisms, which
                may shift liabilities across jurisdictions in an uncoordinated manner. In a crisis, these flows could be
                triggered rapidly, leaving authorities with limited oversight and delayed reaction capacity. This
                structure challenges not only the prudential resilience of the individual issuers, but also the
                integrity of the broader regulatory framework.</p>
            <p>This structural fragility is exacerbated by legal and operational risks. When an EU-based issuer holds
                reserves in a foreign currency (i.e. US dollars), those assets are usually located in the country where
                they were issued, often outside the EU. This means the reserves may be subject to foreign capital
                controls, regulatory restrictions, or settlement delays, particularly in times of market stress. Without
                strong safeguards - such as regulatory equivalence, the mutual enforceability of redemption rights, and
                the free transfer of reserve assets across borders - these arrangements become more vulnerable, opening
                the door to fragmented investor treatment, moral hazard, and broader systemic vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p>In addition, in a multi-issuance model, third-country issuers are not necessarily subject to the same
                consumer protection, transparency, and disclosure requirements as those set out in MiCAR. This asymmetry
                may leave European token holders with lower levels of protection.<sup><a id="footnote-002-backlink"
                        role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-002">27</a></sup></p>
            <p>To mitigate these risks and avoid regulatory blind spots, issuance should be limited to jurisdictions
                that uphold equivalent regulatory standards, ensure redemption at par, and enforce cross-jurisdiction
                crisis protocols. The robustness of a multi-issuer framework hinges on strong cross-border cooperation
                among supervisory authorities, including mechanisms to consistently monitor and verify the adequacy of
                reserves in terms of size, quality, and location.<sup><a id="footnote-001-backlink" role="doc-noteref"

            <p>Without such coordination, there is a real risk of regulatory arbitrage, whereby activity gravitates
                towards the jurisdiction with the least stringent regulations, thereby undermining financial stability
                and investor confidence. For this reason, clarity at the legislative or standard-setting level would be
                both timely and valuable - helping to establish a common playing field, to prevent free-riding, and to
                promote a more coherent and resilient global approach to stablecoin oversight.</p>
            <h2>In search of a path: policy reflections</h2>
            <p>Amidst growing risks and challenges, innovation is reshaping the financial ecosystem. Stablecoins, other
                crypto-assets, tokenized deposits, central bank digital currencies, and additional novel instruments are
                being explored as potential solutions to reduce frictions in the payments landscape.</p>
            <p>For this transformation to be meaningful and sustainable, these new forms of money and services must
                address users' needs, without compromising financial stability, market integrity, and inclusion. But the
                pace of change, the complexity of emerging use cases, and uneven regulation across jurisdictions require
                a consistent and forward-looking policy response.</p>
            <p>Let me share a few reflections on how we might navigate these uncharted waters.</p>
            <p>First, international cooperation remains vital because digital technologies transcend borders. Guidelines
                and recommendations by international standards bodies and the G20's roadmap on cross-border payments
                provide a solid foundation on which to develop an effective regulatory framework. But fast-moving
                progress demands continuous dialogue, adaptable frameworks, and shared accountability.</p>
            <p>Second, innovation must be fostered responsibly, establishing clear rules and standards that balance
                openness to new technologies while safeguarding financial stability, consumer protection, and sound
                market functioning.</p>
            <p>Third, data are critical. To identify risks early and to tailor effective responses, we need common
                metrics and close collaboration with the scientific community and the private sector in order to develop
                better tools and models.</p>
            <p>Returning to the topic of stablecoins, we need specific safeguards for multi-issuance stablecoins, which
                pose complex cross-border challenges. These arrangements require a high degree of trust and transparency
                between jurisdictions. Key safeguards should include regulatory equivalence, mutual enforceability of
                redemption rights, and the absence of legal or operational barriers to asset transfer, especially during
                crisis periods.<sup><a id="footnote-000-backlink" role="doc-noteref" href="#footnote-000">29</a></sup>
                One of the key lessons (learnt) from the global financial crisis is that ring-fencing cannot substitute
                coordination. In a globally interconnected system, divergence only amplifies risks.</p>
            <p>Supervisory frameworks also need to evolve. Activities such as staking, yield farming, and crypto-lending
                often replicate traditional banking functions but without equivalent oversight. The principle of 'same
                activity, same risk, same regulation' must guide our approach.</p>
            <p>Finally, competition must be preserved. While stablecoins may comply with financial regulations, their
                integration into global digital platforms could create potential market imbalances. Ensuring a level
                playing field is critical for protecting consumer choice and maintaining trust. In this regard, the
                European Commission's 2024 review of the definition of relevant markets for antitrust purposes is a
                timely and welcome step.</p>
            <p>Through all of this, the role of central banks remains clear: to provide certainty in uncertain times. We
                must enable innovation while preserving trust, encourage competition while ensuring cohesion, and
                support progress without compromising prudence.</p>
            <p>The path ahead may be complex but it is also full of potential. It is a path that we must navigate
                together - with clarity, coordination, and commitment.</p>
