                    <span class="page-subtitle">An Issues Paper by the Council of Financial Regulators, in consultation with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission – December 2024</span></h1>
                <p>The Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) has today released an Issues Paper: <a href="/publications/consultations/2024/review-into-small-and-medium-sized-banks/review-into-small-and-medium-sized-banks.html">Review into Small
                    and
                    Medium-sized Banks</a>.</p>
                <p>The Treasurer asked the CFR, in consultation with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
                    (ACCC), to examine the state of the small and medium-sized banking sector, with a focus on
                    competition (see <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/review/small-and-medium-sized-banks-review/terms-of-reference">Terms of Reference</a>).</p>
                <p>The Review’s purpose is to consider and report to Government on options and approaches to improving
                    competition in the small and medium-sized banking sector. The CFR is seeking feedback and evidence
                    from stakeholders on the issues facing the small and medium-sized banking sector and how these could
                    be addressed.</p>
                <p>Written submissions to the Issues Paper are requested by 7&nbsp;February 2025.
                    Submissions should be sent to: <a href="mailto:CFRReview@treasury.gov.au">CFRReview@treasury.gov.au</a>.</p>
