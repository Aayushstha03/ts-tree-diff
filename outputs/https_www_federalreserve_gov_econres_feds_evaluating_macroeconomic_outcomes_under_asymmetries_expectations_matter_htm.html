                <h3>Evaluating Macroeconomic Outcomes Under Asymmetries: Expectations Matter</h3>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
                <p>Asymmetries play an important role in many macroeconomic models. We show that assumptions on
                    household and firm expectations play a key role in determining the effects of these asymmetries on
                    macroeconomic outcomes. If households and firms have perfect foresight and hence do not account for
                    the possibility of future shocks, then the implied longer-run averages and distributions for
                    unemployment and inflation can differ significantly from their rational expectations counterparts.
                    We first derive this result analytically under either an asymmetric monetary policy rule or a
                    nonlinear Phillips curve before numerically examining some of the key nonlinearities featured in the
                    recent literature.</p>
