            <p><strong>Report Highlights</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Angola’s economy recovered strongly in
                    2024, with real GDP growing by 4.4%.
                </strong>This growth was driven by the recovery
                of the oil sector and strong dynamism in the
                non-oil sector, particularly in mining,
                commerce, and agriculture. Yet, Angola still did
                not recover the 10.4% loss in real GDP incurred
                in 2016 – 2020.</p>

            <p><strong>The weak labor market and high inflation
                    have eroded households’ living conditions,
                    and poverty remains high at around
                    31.1%</strong>. Inequality also remains
                significant, with a Gini index of 51.3.</p> <img

            <p><strong>Macroeconomic balances have remained
                    sustainable, but there are sources of
                    fragility</strong>. The external account
                improved significantly in 2024, supported by
                lower refined fuel imports, which helped
                strengthen international reserves and stabilize
                the exchange rate. The central bank maintained
                tight monetary policy to combat inflation, which
                remained high at 28.2% in 2024, and the real
                effective exchange rate appreciated sharply.</p>
            <p><strong>Public finances deteriorated slightly in
                    2024, with the fiscal deficit reaching
                    around 1.2% of GDP, despite better
                    revenue</strong>. Public debt decreased to
                71% of GDP, supported by high nominal GDP
                growth. High interest payments on public debt,
                reaching 6.1% of GDP in 2024, crowd out
                expenditure in key sectors like health,
                education or social protection.</p>
            <p><strong>Economic prospects remain moderate, and
                    risks have increased</strong>. Real GDP
                growth is expected to average 2.9% over 2025 –
                27 but will fall short of improving living
                standards for all Angolans. The fiscal position
                is projected to slightly deteriorate in the
                medium term, partly due to the proximity of the
                electoral cycle. Angola is expected to continue
                to register current account surpluses, though
                declining, and the foreign reserves position is
                projected to remain strong. Risks to the outlook
                have increased, in a context of high global
                uncertainty that have resulted in declining oil
                prices, highlighting the need for Angola to
                implement reforms to diversify its economy and
                reduce the reliance on oil.</p>
            <p><strong>Chapter 2 of this first Angola Economic
                    Update focuses on inclusive financial
                    development as a crucial reform to support
                    higher and more diversified growth.</strong>

            <p><i>Financial inclusion refers to the
                    accessibility and availability of financial
                    services to individuals and businesses,
                    especially those who are underserved or
                    excluded from the traditional banking
                    system. Financial inclusion can empower
                    individuals to make informed financial
                    decisions, boost economic growth, and help
                    reducepoverty.</i></p>
            <p>Experience shows that progress in digital
                solutions, such as mobile banking, has played a
                crucial role in expanding financial services to
                remote areas, making financial inclusion a key
                driver of economic and social development. MSMEs
                benefit from inclusive financial systems by
                gaining the capital needed for growth and
                innovation.</p>
            <p><strong>Despite its oil wealth, Angola faces
                    significant inequality and exclusion,
                    particularly in rural areas where many
                    people lack access to formal banking
                    services</strong>. Inclusive financial
                development fosters economic participation and
                resilience, and helps drive long-term,
                sustainable economic progress while breaking the
                cycle of poverty. When small businesses,
                farmers, and entrepreneurs have access to
                banking services, credit, insurance, and other
                financial tools, they are empowered to invest in
                entrepreneurship, leading to higher productivity
                and job creation. Moreover, people can also
                spend money on education and healthcare.
                Additionally, financial inclusion reduces income
                inequality by providing marginalized groups with
                opportunities to build assets and manage
                financial risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Use of Financial Services</strong></p>
            <img src="https://worldbank.scene7.com/is/image/worldbankprod/ag-economic-update-c3?wid=780&amp;hei=439&amp;qlt=85,0&amp;resMode=sharp"

            <p><strong>With the rise of digital banking and
                    mobile payment systems, Angola has an
                    opportunity to expand financial services to
                    underserved populations, thereby
                    strengthening economic resilience and
                    fostering inclusive development.
                </strong>With the right reforms, a stronger and
                more inclusive financial sector can support
                Angola in diversifying its economy and finding
                new drivers of growth and job creation. Ensuring
                broad-based access to financial services beyond
                Luanda is crucial, at a time where Angola aims
                to diversify its economy notably through the
                development of economic activity and value
                chains in the Lobito corridor and the
                strengthening of secondary cities.</p>
            <p><strong>One major challenge is the limited reach
                    of financial institutions, as many banks are
                    concentrated in urban centers, leaving rural
                    communities underserved</strong>.
                Additionally, high banking costs, stringent
                requirements for opening accounts, and a lack of
                financial literacy prevent many Angolans from
                accessing formal financial services. Weak
                infrastructure, including limited internet and
                mobile network coverage in remote areas, also
                hinders the expansion of digital banking
                solutions. Furthermore, economic instability,
                inflation, a lack of trust in financial
                institutions, and governance issues such as
                deficiencies in anti-money laundering and
                combatting the financing of terrorism
                regulations further hinder the development of
                the sector. Addressing these barriers through
                regulatory reforms, digital innovation, and
                financial education is essential to improve
                inclusive financial development.</p>
