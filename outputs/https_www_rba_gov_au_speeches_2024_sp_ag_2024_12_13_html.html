						video: Shedding Light on Uncertainty: Using Scenarios in Forecasting and Policy - Speech
						delivered by Sarah Hunter, Assistant Governor (Economic), University of Adelaide South
						Australian Centre for Economics Studies (SACES) Lunch, Adelaide</a>
					<p>I would first like to pay respect to the traditional and original owners of this land, the Kaurna people,
						to pay respect to those who have passed before us and to acknowledge today’s custodians of this
						land. I also extend that respect to any First Nations people joining us.</p>
					<p>Today I am going to talk about how the RBA uses scenarios – that is, alternative possible pathways
						for the economy to help us think through the outlook for the economy and set monetary policy.</p>
					<p>Our baseline forecast of how the economy may evolve is a key input to the monetary policy decision. It
						represents what we think is the most likely single path for the economy. But it’s only one path, and
						the chance of that precise path being the one that happens is approximately zero. So, acknowledging the
						uncertainty inherent in our forecasts is core to making good policy decisions.</p>
					<p>The systematic use of scenario analysis is common in many professions where decisions are made under
						uncertainty – economists are not alone in not knowing exactly how things will play out. For
						example, scenario analysis is a fundamental part of financial stress testing exercises that are conducted
						on a regular basis by prudential regulators. Many central banks use scenarios internally to inform their
						policy decisions, and some publish them. The value of scenarios has been re-emphasised by the recent
						Bernanke Review of the Bank of England and our own RBA Review, which recommended greater use of scenarios
						to inform policy.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1" id="r1" aria-label="Go to endnote 1">[1]</a></sup></p>
					<p>So, why are scenarios useful?</p>
					<p>As forecasters, they can help us think through and communicate risks around our baseline. For example, by
						identifying which risks the forecast might be particularly sensitive to, and the balance of risks around
						the central case. They can also help us keep an open mind about alternative explanations for how the
						economy is evolving.</p>
					<p>For policymakers, scenarios can provide a tangible link between risks and policy strategy. They allow
						policymakers to explore how a given policy option performs depending on how risks play out, or to compare
						alternatives. They also have the potential to help policymakers communicate how monetary policy may
						respond as conditions evolve – in economists’ parlance, to better communicate their reaction
						function.</p>
					<p>I’ll develop these points in the rest of my remarks, and along the way talk through some examples of
						recent scenarios we have used. But before I get into scenarios, I want to briefly set the scene by
						outlining the baseline forecast process, and why the forecasts almost always turn out to be wrong in some
						way.</p>
					<h2>Forecasts are an important input to monetary policy&nbsp;…</h2>
					<p>The baseline forecast represents our central view of how the economy will unfold, conditional on a series
						of assumptions including the exchange rate and the market-implied path for the cash rate. The forecasts
						also embed a set of judgements about how the economy may evolve. We typically call out the judgements we
						think are most important in the <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy </cite> (SMP), alongside the
						forecasts. Recently the key judgements have included assessments of the supply capacity of the economy,
						the trajectory of the labour market, and the extent to which households will spend their income.</p>
					<p>The judgements and forecasts are built on a wide range of analysis of the data, models that embody
						relationships and linkages across the economy, and our assessment of how these relationships may evolve
						differently to what we’ve seen in the past. As well as resulting in quantitative forecasts, this
						process helps to refine the staff’s narrative for the economy. Constructing a narrative in parallel
						with detailed outcomes can help test the forecasts and it helps us to communicate our view of the
						economy.</p>
					<p>But we know the future is uncertain, and the forecasts will usually be wrong in various ways. Given the
						uncertainty in forecasts, why spend so much time and effort on them? The answer is that monetary policy
						operates with a lag, which means the Board needs to think ahead when setting the cash rate target today.
					</p>
					<p>Given the importance of looking ahead in the monetary policy decision and the fact that we know forecasts
						often do not come to pass, there is significant value in thinking through the ways in which actual
						outcomes might deviate from the forecast. As we will see, scenarios help us do that.</p>
					<h2>…&nbsp;but all forecasts turn out to be at least partially wrong</h2>
					<p>But first, why do forecasts turn out to be wrong? There are some things about the future we can be
						relatively confident about. For example, we know people typically spend more money in the last quarter of
						the year in the lead up to the holiday season. Observations like this are so normal that we always look
						through them and focus on the underlying picture.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2" id="r2" aria-label="Go to endnote 2">[2]</a></sup> That said, even the seasonal pattern of household
						spending is shifting, with the ongoing growth in Australia of Black Friday sales in November displacing
						some spending from December. That is just the tip of the uncertainty iceberg – there are many
						reasons why actual outcomes depart from the forecasts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Most obviously, unpredictable events that will have a meaningful impact on the macroeconomy can
							happen. Think of the pandemic, an unexpected change in domestic or foreign government policy and
							one-off weather events that affect prices or economic activity.</li>
						<li>Relationships between variables can turn out differently than expected – for example,
							households might save more (or less) of their income than they usually do. Or, our models and
							analytical frameworks designed to capture these relationships could be incorrect or incomplete.</li>
						<li>Assessments of the current state of the economy could be wrong. That could be due to imprecise data
							– which are often subject to sizeable revisions – or imprecise assessments of economic
							concepts like spare capacity that we can only infer from the data. Any errors in the assessment of
							the current state of the world are likely to translate into forecast errors.</li>
						<li>Undetected or uncertain structural changes in the economy can cause unforeseen outcomes. A change in
							the potential growth rate of the economy – maybe caused by the green energy transition, AI
							adoption or other technological changes – would have wide-ranging effects on variables we
							forecast.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These examples are specific cases where our baseline outlook for the economy may not come to pass. One way
						of quantifying and communicating general uncertainty in the forecasts is the ‘fan charts’ that
						the RBA shows in the SMP. These charts show the historical range of forecast errors around the current
						central forecasts, in this case inflation (Graph&nbsp;1). The dark blue range shows that
						70&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of two-year ahead inflation forecasts have fallen within
						±&nbsp;1&nbsp;percentage points of the central forecasts since 1993, and 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
						fall within ±&nbsp;2&nbsp;percentage points.</p>

The 90 per cent confidence interval around the forecast of trimmed mean inflation by December quarter 2026 spans from around ¾ per cent to around 4½ per cent." width="" height="" loading="lazy">

					</div>
					<p>This picture highlights that we can’t be very confident that our central projections will come to
						pass!</p>
					<h2>Scenarios help us understand and communicate specific risks and judgements</h2>
					<p>While the fan charts illustrate the typical level of uncertainty around our forecasts, scenarios enable a
						richer discussion of specific ways in which our baseline forecasts may be wrong. This could be due to any
						of the sources of uncertainty I talked about earlier – the risk of unpredictable events, economic
						relationships turning out to be different to what we thought, and so on.</p>
					<p>Constructing a scenario involves making alternative assumptions to the ones in our baseline forecast about
						how things we are uncertain about play out, and thinking through what that implies for the economic
						outlook. We often use economic models to explore how these alternative assumptions affect economic
						outcomes.</p>
					<p>Part of the value of producing scenarios is that they help us build our own understanding of which risks
						are important, because the scenario makes clear how sensitive the outlook is to a given risk. That can
						help us decide which issues we need to dig into more to understand better.</p>
					<p>Scenarios also provide a way for us to communicate the risks that we think are most important, and a
						tangible way of illustrating and quantifying them. By tracing through the impact of a risk onto both
						inflation and unemployment, they help us to understand how risks around those variables are connected in
						a way that fan charts cannot.</p>
					<p>For us as forecasters, there is a further possible philosophical benefit to producing scenarios: I wonder
						if it might reduce the chance that we become too attached to our central forecast narrative. Constructing
						scenarios means thinking through alternative narratives, and that should help us keep an open mind when
						our central forecast turns out to be wrong. And as I said earlier, it almost certainly will be wrong in
						some way.</p>
					<p>More concretely, scenarios can help us identify the indicators and outcomes that will tell us when we are
						deviating from our baseline view. This helps us to identify when things are playing out differently,
						allowing us to update our baseline forecast accordingly.</p>
					<p>I’ll return in a minute to talk about the value of scenarios in informing the policy decision. But
						let me first give two recent examples of scenarios we have used.</p>
					<h3>Household income growth and consumption</h3>
					<p>A key uncertainty we’ve been considering recently is how household income growth will affect
						consumption in the coming years. Household real income is currently being lifted by the Stage Three tax
						cuts taking effect. But we cannot be certain how consumers will react to this lift in income. Running
						different scenarios allows us to see how the different responses might play out and how material this
						would be for the labour market and inflation. The alternative plausible paths for consumption
						(Graph&nbsp;2) and the savings rate led to noticeably different paths for inflation and unemployment that
						would have consequences for policy setting (Graph&nbsp;3).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3" id="r3" aria-label="Go to endnote 3">[3]</a></sup></p>

The graph also shows higher consumption scenario implies lower a lower unemployment rate and slower disinflation compared to the August 2024 SMP forecasts." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>We first published these scenarios in our August SMP.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4" id="r4" aria-label="Go to endnote 4">[4]</a></sup> As the charts show, the different cases have
						material implications for inflation and the labour market. With this in mind, RBA staff are closely
						monitoring actual outturns and assessing their implication for the outlook for the labour market and
						inflation. To relate this to the chart, we’re evolving our assessment of whether we’re on the
						orange, blue or green lines. And the answer to this question is critical to the Board, as a move to the
						scenarios depicted in green or orange may require a change in policy strategy – I’ll return to
						that point later.</p>
					<h3>Higher Chinese fiscal spending</h3>
					<p>External risks to the Australian economy can also be interrogated with scenarios. At any given time, there
						are many known external risks (as well as unknown unknowns). Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser discussed one
						of the key unknowns, the global trading environment, in his speech earlier this week.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5" id="r5" aria-label="Go to endnote 5">[5]</a></sup> Another
						current example of a material external risk is the path of future Chinese fiscal policy. China is a large
						economy and Australia’s largest export destination, which means its trajectory is important for
						Australian monetary policy setting. One way we have explored that is to consider the effects of Chinese
						fiscal spending being higher than expected. There are several ways this could affect the Australian
						economy:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6" id="r6" aria-label="Go to endnote 6">[6]</a></sup>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stronger demand in China increases prices for commodities that Australia exports as well as the price
							of Chinese exports to Australia. Higher commodity prices increase Australian corporate profits and
							government tax receipts, some of which could lead to increased spending. </li>
						<li>Stronger Chinese demand also increases demand for other Australian exports. Services export volumes
							are more responsive to demand so there would likely be a direct activity channel for service exports.
							This could be offset to some extent, however, through adjustments via the exchange rate.</li>
						<li>Similarly, stronger demand in China lifts activity in China’s other trading partners, many of
							which are important destinations for Australian exports.</li>
						<li>Financial channels impact the Australian economy. While direct financial links with China are minimal
							compared with trade links, Chinese activity influences exchange rates and asset prices. A large
							Chinese stimulus package would likely be associated with an appreciation of the Australian dollar and
							potentially boost equity market sentiment.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The scenario we consider is a very large stimulus package, beyond what we have assumed in our current
						baseline forecast profile (Graph&nbsp;4). It is not an outcome we think is likely to be announced in the
						near term. Looking at a large, if unlikely, stimulus gives a sense of what it might mean for the
						Australian economy and also illuminates the channels that would be at play for a smaller stimulus
						(Graph&nbsp;5).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7" id="r7" aria-label="Go to endnote 7">[7]</a></sup> While here we look at the impact of a stimulus package
						in isolation, in practice a large stimulus would be most likely if growth prospects in China were to
						deteriorate for some reason. In that case, the impact on the Australian economy would differ from the
						scenario.</p>

					<h2>Scenarios and monetary policy</h2>
					<p>The goal of all this work is ultimately to help inform good monetary policymaking.</p>
					<p>I’ve already explained how scenarios help us understand and communicate the importance of different
						risks to the outlook<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8" id="r8" aria-label="Go to endnote 8">[8]</a></sup> and the economy’s sensitivity to different
						channels. For example, the China fiscal stimulus scenario shows how Australian outcomes might be affected
						by Chinese policy, and how transmission of the stimulus might be sensitive to movements in the exchange
						rate.</p>
					<p>I will focus now on how scenarios can inform the policy decision itself. Clearly, central forecasts are
						important inputs to monetary policy decisions. But the extent of uncertainty means it’s equally
						important for policymakers to consider alternative scenarios, their likelihood and how their strategies
						might need to adapt.</p>
					<p>The key point is that scenarios help to make the link between forecast risks and policy strategy. That
						helps the Board think through policy options and communicate their thinking. In particular:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scenarios allow policymakers to consider how to make their strategy more robust to key risks
							materialising. That might mean choosing a policy strategy that performs well – in terms of
							inflation and employment outcomes – under a range of possible scenarios, rather than just in
							the most likely central forecast. </li>
						<li>Scenarios can also help the Board communicate how policy settings might need to respond if the
							economic outlook unfolds differently to our baseline. As flagged earlier, in economist-speak they can
							help the Board to communicate its reaction function to financial market participants and the public,
							helping them understand what might happen to interest rates over time. For example, the November
							Board minutes show examples of the Board considering alternative risks to the outlook for household
							spending and the labour market, and mapping those through to the potential consequences for
							policy.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9" id="r9" aria-label="Go to endnote 9">[9]</a></sup></li>
					</ul>
					<p>To make this more concrete, Graphs 6&nbsp;and 7&nbsp;provide an illustration of the sort of scenarios we
						might look at to map from risks to possible policy responses. I should emphasise that these are not
						actual scenarios the Board has considered – while some central banks publish the alternative policy
						paths that inform their decisions, the RBA has not yet done so. The graphs show hypothetical policy
						responses to illustrative scenarios where demand and therefore inflation are stronger or weaker than a
						base profile.</p>
					<p>The Board has consistently communicated that it is aiming to return inflation to the midpoint of the
						target band (2.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) in a timely manner while retaining as many of the gains in the
						labour market as possible. The two cases considered here do not achieve these outcomes. That is, they
						would not bring the economy back into balance in the second half of 2026; in the strong-demand scenario,
						inflation would remain above 2.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, while in the weak-demand scenario it would drop
						below 2.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent by the end of the forecast horizon (see solid black lines in right-hand
						panels of Graphs 6&nbsp;and 7).</p>
					<p>While the policy paths shown in these charts are not necessarily ones the Board would follow, the two
						scenarios are illustrative of how the strategy may need to be adapted as conditions unfold. In the upside
						scenario the Board may need to consider a tighter policy stance – this could be a rate hike or a
						longer period on hold. In the downside scenario, the Board may need to consider a looser stance –
						for example, by bringing forward rate cuts.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Where does all this leave us?</p>
					<p>Each quarter, the RBA staff prepare a forecast for the economy, based on their careful assessment of the
						data, and past historical relationships, but acknowledging it relies on many judgments and assumptions.
						We select key judgments and risks to create scenarios that might differ from our central forecast. These
						scenarios help RBA staff understand the risks and they feed into the policy advice, though they only
						cover a fraction of the overall uncertainty.</p>
					<p>The Board evaluates this information when setting policy, focusing on the strategy’s robustness amid
						inherent risks and the delayed effects of monetary policy on the economy. We hope the scenarios we
						publish help financial markets and the public better understand the forecasts and policy decisions,
						encouraging broader debate and discussion.</p>
