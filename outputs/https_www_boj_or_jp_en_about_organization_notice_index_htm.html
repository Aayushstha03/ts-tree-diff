      <!-- [START] CONTENT_1 --><p>The Bank of Japan is warning the public about scams using the Bank's name or claiming to be a member of staff in attempts to fraudulently obtain money, property, or personal financial information such as bank account information. In some of these scams, fraudsters solicit investments on a bogus website using the Bank's name. The Bank's staff would never request such information, collect payment cards, cash, or the like, nor solicit investments on the Bank's website. The Bank does not offer deposit accounts to individuals or corporate entities other than financial institutions.</p>
<p>Cases have also been reported in which there have been posts of fake information about the Bank or its staff, or false information has been posted on fake websites and social networking sites impersonating the Bank or its staff.</p>
<p>Please note that the Bank is not connected in any way with these matters.</p>
<p>The Bank's official English-language website, social networking sites and YouTube channel are as follows.

<p>If you receive any suspicious communication using the Bank's name or claiming to be a member of staff via phone, e-mail, in person, or by other means, please report this to the nearest police station or your local law enforcement agency.</p><!-- [END] CONTENT_1 --><!-- [START] CONTENT_2 --><h2 id="p01">Releases Related to Scams</h2>
