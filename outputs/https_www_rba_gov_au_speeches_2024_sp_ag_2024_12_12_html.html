					<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHRoakg2ydM">Watch video: The Future of the Payments System - Speech delivered by Brad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System), AusPayNet Summit 2024, Sydney</a></p><p>Thank you for the invitation to open the batting at this year’s AusPayNet Summit. This forum is
						always a highlight on the calendar − for industry and policymakers alike − and I am sure this year will
						be no different.</p>
					<p>Not so long ago, opining on the future of the payments system may have been a somewhat mundane affair. Not
						a great deal changed from one year to the next, and not too many folks, other than the true payment
						system diehards, were interested.</p>
					<p>Not so now.</p>
					<p>For a start, our payments system is rapidly evolving. New innovations are springing up at a dizzying pace.
					</p>
					<p>And the payments system has never been more critical to the functioning of the economy. Almost
						$300&nbsp;billion in payments now settle across the RBA’s central infrastructure each day. This is
						equivalent to Australia’s annual GDP flowing through the payments system every 10&nbsp;days.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, debates over the future of money and payments now regularly feature in the public square
						– and as I am discovering, the public square very much extends to summer barbeque conversations. In
						some sense, money and technology have always been the subject of popular fascination, but this seems
						especially true today.</p>
					<p>In short, to channel a former Prime Minister, it has never been a more exciting time to be in payments.
					</p>
					<p>My remarks today will focus on the challenges and opportunities in front of all of us involved in
						payments. There is no shortage of both. But before diving in, let me briefly set the scene by
						highlighting where our payments system stands today, and the RBA’s role in it.</p>
					<h2>The current state of Australia’s payments system</h2>
					<p>Australia has a payments system that we can be proud of. By global standards, it is fast, efficient and
						reliable. This is evident not only in the data, but from the discussions that I and my colleagues at the
						RBA and on the Payments System Board regularly have with our international counterparts. It is also worth
						noting that for the better part of a couple of decades, retail merchant card payment costs have trended
						lower in Australia in response to increased transparency and competitive tension in the market for
						payments services (Graph&nbsp;1). Some of this competitive tension has arisen organically, and some of it
						has come about as a result of intervention by the RBA.</p>

" width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>This brings me to the mandate of the RBA and the Payments System Board.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1" aria-label="Go to endnote 1">[1]</a></sup> At the broadest level, this
						mandate is to help shape the payments system so that it works in the best interests of Australian
						households and businesses. Our north star is promoting the public interest. We strive to achieve this
						through a combination of suasion, regulation and working with industry participants to help overcome the
						coordination issues that can bedevil payment systems.</p>
					<p>In seeking to promote efficiency, competition and safety in the payments system, we also recognise the
						important role of innovation in serving the public interest. Australia’s productivity growth
						challenges make this all the more pertinent. One can think of the New Payments Platform (NPP) as a
						notable example of this focus (Graph&nbsp;2). More recently, this year the RBA materially raised the
						activity threshold beyond which securities settlement facilities must comply with the Financial Stability
						Standards. It was assessed that the higher threshold struck a more appropriate balance between the public
						interest in the management of financial stability risks, and the public interest in avoiding excessive
						regulatory burden (particularly on small enterprises). And as I will discuss later, we also recently
						launched a new project with industry to examine how central bank digital currency, stablecoins and
						tokenised bank deposits could, along with new infrastructure arrangements, support innovation and
						resilience in wholesale tokenised asset markets.</p>

In almost seven years since it’s launch, Australian’s are executing an average around 62 transactions per year." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Where innovation promises to not only enhance efficiency but also resilience and safety in our financial
						system, all the better. This recognises that we are entering a new era for operational risk – a
						result of rising geopolitical tension and other sources of potential disruption that include third-party
						vendors. For these reasons, strengthening resilience in our payment system and our financial market
						infrastructure is a key area of focus for the RBA in its work with other member agencies on the Council
						of Financial Regulators.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2" aria-label="Go to endnote 2">[2]</a></sup></p>
					<p>This aside, the RBA is also working with the government to make sure that Australia’s regulatory
						architecture is fit for purpose in the 21st century. This is a pressing issue given the foundational
						legislation setting out the RBA’s powers was drafted in another era – one prior to the
						emergence of the digital economy that will be essential to Australia’s future prosperity.</p>
					<p>If there is one message to takeaway from my remarks today, it is this – while we should recognise
						that Australia has a world class payments system today, it would be a mistake to assume the same will be
						true in five or 10&nbsp;years’ time without a concerted effort from everyone involved in payments.
						Of course, the RBA has a key role here and we remain committed to working constructively with industry in
						promoting the public interest. But ultimately, how industry responds to these challenges and
						opportunities will determine whether it will be able to deliver the services that Australians will need
						and should expect in the future.</p>
					<h2>Account-to-account payments</h2>
					<p>In the spirit of facing into challenges, let me begin with account-to-account payments. In her speech to
						this Summit last year,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3" aria-label="Go to endnote 3">[3]</a></sup> the Governor spoke about industry’s decision to
						target the decommissioning of the BECS framework by 2030. The setting of a target date by industry has
						helped to focus attention across the ecosystem. But there is much to do here.</p>
					<p>BECS is the workhorse of the account-to-account payments system. While the share of account-to-account
						transfers made through the NPP has increased notably (Graph&nbsp;3), BECS is still used to process the
						majority of account-to-account payments. This includes payroll, pension and support payments that are
						critical to Australians.</p>
					<div>
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<p><span>Graph 3</span></p>
							</figcaption>
							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-ag-2024-12-12-graph03.svg" alt="Graph 3: Line graph of ‘NPP Share of Account-to-Account Transfers – by number, monthly, seasonally adjusted’. Shows the share of account-to-account transactions occurring across the NPP growing steadily from around 2% in mid-2018 to around 32% in mid 2024." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Given the importance of BECS to our financial system, this year the Payments System Board asked RBA staff
						to undertake a risk assessment of the intended decommissioning. The risk assessment, which will be
						reported to the Board in March 2025, is drawing attention to some issues that will need to be addressed
						to facilitate an orderly decommissioning.</p>
					<p>In the course of engaging with a wide range of stakeholders – banks, payment service providers,
						payment schemes, end users and government agencies – RBA staff have heard plenty of support for the
						migration to more modern payment rails such as the NPP. There are features of the NPP that many
						stakeholders find beneficial, including <span>24/7</span>&nbsp;operation, real-time
						settlement, richer data and enhanced data exchange capabilities.</p>
					<p>At the same time, some stakeholders have raised concerns about aspects of the migration. I will set these
						out in a moment, but my colleagues at the RBA and on the Payments System Board see the central challenge
						as this – industry is yet to arrive at a shared vision of the desired features of
						account-to-account payments in Australia. This is a foundational issue. While the point of departure has
						been announced by industry – transitioning from BECS as we know it – establishing a common
						vision of the features underpinning a desired end state will be essential if a program of this scale is
						to succeed. Once a consensus has emerged here, a roadmap with milestones can guide industry progress
						toward the ultimate objective.</p>
					<p>Now let me share with you some of the feedback we have heard so far:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>There has been insufficient industry coordination, planning and certainty regarding the
								transition. </strong> This in turn has had made it difficult for industry participants to press
							on with their individual plans, including those who will have a key role in ensuring the ongoing
							competitiveness and safety of the system.</li>
						<li><strong>There is scope for the needs of end users to be given more prominence in industry discussions
								on the future of account-to-account payments.</strong> BECS is the payment rail used to make the
							majority of essential payments to millions of Australians, so any replacement must be capable of
							reliably meeting end user needs.</li>
						<li><strong>A solution for the processing of bulk payments will be important.</strong><sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4" aria-label="Go to endnote 4">[4]</a> </sup> Key
							end users need confidence that bulk payments will be supported into the future, recognising that many
							have integrated systems that manage the initiation and reconciliation of payment instructions. The
							NPP and the fast settlement service (FSS) will need to have capacity to handle a much higher volume
							of payments.</li>
						<li><strong>The cost of the transition and per transaction costs in the future system are a concern for
								some stakeholders.</strong> End users, including those who do not have advanced functionality
							requirements, understandably want options that represent value for money. The RBA is working to
							better understand the pricing of account-to-account payments. </li>
						<li><strong>Many stakeholders have expressed a desire for resilience to feature prominently in future
								account-to-account system arrangements.</strong> BECS outages have typically been low
							(Graph&nbsp;4). Contingency arrangements in the future system will need to ensure that end user needs
							can continue to be met even when operational issues are experienced.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5" aria-label="Go to endnote 5">[5]</a></sup> This
							suggests resilience will need to be built into the solution from the outset. As mentioned earlier,
							the RBA and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) are stepping up their focus on
							operational resilience in the financial system, including payments.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6" aria-label="Go to endnote 6">[6]</a></sup></li>
						<li><strong>End users will be unable to move payments from BECS until all customers can receive payments
								via an alternative channel.</strong> Some banks using BECS are yet to connect to the NPP, and
							even for those that have done so, some of their BECS-reachable accounts are not currently reachable
							via the NPP. It might be that not all of these unreachable accounts will need transactional
							capabilities in the future, but this is something institutions need to examine.</li>
					</ol>

" width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Let me offer a positive take on this feedback. It has surfaced some issues that, if addressed
						appropriately, can give industry a solid basis on which to move forward. The focus on resilience,
						functionality and end user needs is particularly relevant here. The announcement by industry of a target
						date of 2030 for BECS decommissioning has already sparked some useful dialogue. But all stakeholders need
						a voice, and a broad consensus on some key issues is now essential if Australia’s account-to-account
						payment system arrangements are going to be fit-for-purpose in the next decade. Time is now of the
						essence.</p>
					<h2>Review of Retail Payments Regulation</h2>
					<p>As many of you will be aware, the RBA recently launched a Review of Retail Payments Regulation.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7" aria-label="Go to endnote 7">[7]</a></sup> While we
						hoped to conduct a broad review, including of issues arising from new types of players and technologies
						in digital payments, proposed amendments to the <cite>Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998</cite> (PSRA)
						that would bring relevant participants into the RBA’s regulatory remit currently remain before the
						Australian Parliament. Given the limitations of our remit under the current PSRA and the significance of
						the issues, it is important that these reforms are passed as soon as possible.</p>
					<p>For now, we are focused on whether there are further actions the RBA could take to put downward pressure
						on merchant card payment costs and whether the surcharging framework remains fit for purpose. These
						issues can be dealt with under the PSRA in its current form and are inextricably linked: merchants are
						less likely to surcharge if their payment costs are low. Given the shift towards electronic payments,
						card payment costs are an ongoing concern for merchants, as they are for consumers. Keeping downward
						pressure on merchant fees for card payments, particularly for smaller merchants that tend to be charged
						higher fees, will keep consumer costs down, and so is an important priority for the RBA.</p>
					<p>The Issues Paper for the Review outlines a broad suite of issues and possible policy responses for
						stakeholders to consider. We have asked for feedback on the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the current level of interchange fee benchmarks and caps, and whether there is a case for more
							structural changes to interchange regulation<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8" aria-label="Go to endnote 8">[8]</a></sup></li>
						<li>whether further regulatory action could increase competitive pressure on scheme fees and whether
							further action is required to promote least-cost routing for in-person transactions</li>
						<li>options to reduce complexity and improve transparency to facilitate merchants shopping around to get
							the best value, as this would boost competition in the acquiring market. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>As the payments landscape has evolved significantly since the surcharging framework was introduced in
						2003, it is timely to review whether the current rules are still achieving their intended purpose. There
						are arguments on both sides of this debate, and we recognise that some views are strongly held. We are
						open to exploring all possible options to find a position that will best serve the public interest,
						consistent with our legislative mandate.</p>
					<p>Some of the arguments for retaining the current surcharging framework include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>it provides a price signal to consumers to use a lower cost payment option – where consumers
							vote with their feet, this puts competitive pressure on card networks to lower their wholesale fees
						</li>
						<li>merchants value the ability to surcharge to recover the cost of payment choices made by customers
						</li>
						<li>surcharging rules have made a significant contribution to the long-run decline in average fees that
							merchants pay for card transactions (recall Graph&nbsp;1).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>However, the decline in cash usage, increased prevalence of surcharging and changes in the way merchants
						are charged for card payments have led to reasonable concerns about the current framework. In particular:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fewer consumers transact with cash today and are therefore unable to avoid card surcharges at the
							point-of-sale.</li>
						<li>Many small merchants are now on blended or single-rate payment plans that charge the same fee to
							merchants for accepting all types of cards. This dulls the price signal to consumers, and can mean
							users of cheaper card payments cross-subsidise users of more expensive cards.</li>
						<li>Consumers are sometimes unaware of the surcharge amount before paying and/or surcharged for amounts
							in excess of merchants’ cost of acceptance.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="r9" aria-label="Go to endnote 9">[9]</a></sup></li>
					</ul>
					<p>We received over 70&nbsp;submissions to our Issues Paper, many from institutions represented here today.
						Thank you to those who took the time to set out their views. We plan to publish submissions on our
						website in January, and to take a summary of the feedback you have provided to the Payments System Board
						in March. Following this, we aim to release a consultation paper with potential policy actions around
						mid- 2025. Thereafter a conclusions paper would set out the Board’s final decisions, likely by the
						end of the year.</p>
					<h2>Cross-border payments</h2>
					<p>I’ll now turn to the topic of cross-border payments.</p>
					<p>Australian businesses and households that undertake international activities need efficient and safe ways
						to send and receive money. But cross-border payments services are still more expensive, more opaque and
						slower than their domestic counterparts. Enhancing cross-border payments is therefore one of the Payments
						System Board’s strategic priorities and an international commitment for Australia under the
						G20&nbsp;Roadmap.</p>
					<p>A recent review by the Financial Stability Board indicated that much more progress is needed to move
						toward the G20&nbsp;Roadmap cost targets.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="r10" aria-label="Go to endnote 10">[10]</a></sup> Lowering the cost of cross-border payment services
						has proven challenging almost everywhere. In Australia, we estimate that the average cost of sending
						A$1,000&nbsp;to other countries still significantly exceeds the relevant G20&nbsp;targets
						(Graph&nbsp;5).<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11" aria-label="Go to endnote 11">[11]</a></sup></p>
					<div>
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<p><span>Graph 5</span></p>
							</figcaption>
							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-ag-2024-12-12-graph05.svg" alt="Graph 5: Bar graph of International Money Transfer Costs as a proportion of a A$1000 transfer from Australian accounts. Shows the weighted average cost of sending money overseas to advanced economies is around 2.6% for - exceeding 1% G20 retail transaction target. For developing economies the average cost is 3.5%, exceeding the 3% G20 remittance target. For sending money to both advanced and developing economies banks are significantly more expensive than non-bank service providers. Bank and non-bank costs are around 4.4% and 1.5% for sending to advanced economies, and 5.2% and 2.3% for sending to developing economies." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>However, the cost of sending money overseas from Australia can vary significantly across providers. Banks
						are generally more expensive than non-bank providers, reflecting the size of the mark-ups they typically
						apply to the wholesale foreign exchange rate. By contrast, there are some non-bank digital providers
						offering prices that are around, or a bit below, the G20&nbsp;target levels. These differences highlight
						the importance of transparency over prices and of customers shopping around.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="r12" aria-label="Go to endnote 12">[12]</a></sup></p>
					<p>The speed of cross-border payments is another area where more progress is required. Bank-intermediated
						cross-border transactions often take a day or more to reach the recipient. Slow processing reflects a
						range of factors including differing operating hours, inconsistent payments messaging practices, and
						complex compliance checks.</p>
					<p>Making use of the new NPP International Payments Service, which allows the final Australian dollar leg of
						inbound cross-border payments to be processed on a near real-time <span>24/7</span>&nbsp;basis, will help. There are also a range of ISO 20022 messaging
						initiatives where more progress is needed.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="r13" aria-label="Go to endnote 13">[13]</a></sup> Achieving international consistency in the data
						carried in payments messages will reduce the need for manual intervention by providers in the processing
						of cross-border payments, and therefore increase the speed and lower the costs of transactions.</p>
					<p>Finally, the RBA continues to participate in initiatives like Project Mandala, a collaboration with the
						Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub and the central banks of South Korea, Malaysia and
						Singapore. This project examines a common technical model for automating regulatory compliance processes
						in cross-border payments, including sanctions and AML/CTF requirements, with a view to increasing the
						speed of compliance procedures and reducing failed transactions.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="r14" aria-label="Go to endnote 14">[14]</a></sup></p>
					<h2>The future of digital money</h2>
					<p>This leads me to another focus area for the RBA and the Payments System Board – shaping the future
						of money in Australia. A central element of this program is determining whether there is a public policy
						case to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Australia, and if so, in what form. We
						recently published a report with Treasury that provided an updated assessment of the case for a CBDC in
						Australia, and outlined, for the first time, a three-year roadmap for future work.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="r15" aria-label="Go to endnote 15">[15]</a></sup></p>
					<p>Our current assessment is that a public interest case to issue a retail CBDC has yet to emerge in
						Australia. At the present time, we see the potential benefits of a retail CBDC as modest or uncertain,
						relative to the challenges it would likely introduce. However, as these trade-offs could evolve over
						time, and as more international experience comes to light, the RBA and the Treasury will continue to
						examine the issues.</p>
					<p>Like a number of central banks in advanced economies, we see the potential case for a wholesale CBDC as
						more promising, though not definitive at this point. A wholesale CBDC could have a key role in
						facilitating the settlement of transactions in tokenised asset markets, and in enhancing cross-border
						payments. This recognises the key role of central bank money in serving as the ultimate safe settlement
						asset, particularly in systemically important markets – a point emphasised in international
						standards. Implementing a wholesale CBDC is also likely to be less disruptive and pose fewer policy
						challenges than issuing a retail CBDC. It would represent a more incremental change to existing
						arrangements where digital central bank money is already issued to eligible financial institutions in the
						form of Exchange Settlement Account balances. But there are still issues that require closer scrutiny
						here.</p>
					<p>In that respect, we have made a strategic commitment to prioritise our applied research agenda on
						innovations in wholesale digital money – namely, wholesale CBDC, tokenised bank deposits and
						stablecoins. Our most immediate priority is to launch a new research project with the Digital Finance
						Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC), known as Project Acacia. Our focus here is on opportunities to
						uplift the efficiency, transparency and resilience of wholesale markets through tokenised money, assets
						and new settlement infrastructure. We recently published a consultation paper seeking industry feedback
						and inviting expressions of interest to collaborate with the RBA and the DFCRC as part of this
						project.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="r16" aria-label="Go to endnote 16">[16]</a></sup> I encourage anyone who is interested to reach out to
						our project team.</p>
					<p>In addition to Project Acacia, we have a number of other CBDC initiatives in line over the next year. We
						are currently exploring options for engaging with the public to better understand their needs,
						preferences and concerns relating to CBDC. We are also planning to convene industry and academic forums
						to provide more systematic engagement with external experts on retail and wholesale CBDC issues.</p>
					<p>In short, we have an ambitious agenda on the future of money. But all our efforts are directed to ensuring
						that our future monetary arrangements are fit for purpose in the digital age.</p>
					<h2>The future of cash</h2>
					<p>While cash use has declined in recent decades, it remains an important means of payment for many folks in
						our community (Graph&nbsp;6). A significant number of Australians still primarily rely on cash to
						participate in the economy, including our more vulnerable members of society. Cash remains an important
						store of value, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. And in serving as a backup means of
						payment when electronic payment methods are unavailable, including during system outages or natural
						disasters, cash helps to promote a more resilient payment system overall. For these reasons, the
						government and the RBA remain committed to supporting access to cash.</p>
					<div>
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<p><span>Graph 6</span></p>
							</figcaption>
							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-ag-2024-12-12-graph06.svg" alt="Graph 6:	Line graph showing ‘Value of Cash Withdrawals – monthly, seasonally adjusted’. Total values of cash withdrawals have declined in value from 2012 to 2024 from around $15 billion a month to $12.5 billion a month. This appears to have been driven by a long-term decline in ATM withdrawals (declining from $12.5 billion in 2012 to $9 billion in 2024) and a more recent decline in OTC withdrawals (over $6 billion in 2018 declining to $3 billlion in 2020 then staying around this level to end 2024). Cash advances and debit card cash outs have also declined over time, but make up a very small share of total cash withdrawals. " width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>However, as cash use has declined, the cost of moving it around the country has increased. A significant
						effort to put cash-in-transit services on a more solid financial footing is now underway across industry.
						But there is still considerable work to be done to develop a sustainable long-term model for cash
						distribution. The challenge now for industry is to deliver more efficient cash distribution services,
						while meeting the public interest in ensuring cash remains an affordable and viable means of payment for
						Australians.</p>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Let me wrap up. Australians expect their payments to be convenient, reliable and represent value for
						money. At the RBA, we share these expectations. We want to see a payments system that is a hotbed of
						innovation and competitive tension, driving efficiency up and costs down. And we want to see a payments
						system that is safe and resilient – one that Australians can rely on.</p>
					<p>As we contemplate what shape the payments system of the future might take, my colleagues and I at the RBA
						and on the Payments System Board are committed to working constructively with AusPayNet and the wider
						industry. We are in this together. There is much to celebrate in the Australian payments system, but as
						I’ve made clear today, also much to do.</p>
					<p>On that note, I look forward to taking your questions.</p>
					<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p id="fn5" aria-label="Endnote 5">BECS is a technologically simpler solution than
								modern payment rails. While this simplicity means that it is no longer fit for purpose for many
								payment use cases, it does have some desirable features. In particular, end users do not expect
								instant payments processing across BECS. When operational issues affect availability of the
								service, the payments can be delivered in a subsequent batch settlement without much impact to
								the end user. <a href="#r5" aria-label="Back to content">[5]</a>
