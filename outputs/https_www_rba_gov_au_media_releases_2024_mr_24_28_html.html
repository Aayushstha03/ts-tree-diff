					<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia welcomes the appointment of new members to the Governance Board and Monetary
						Policy Board.</p>
					<p>In particular I extend my gratitude to Carol Schwartz&nbsp;AO and Elana Rubin&nbsp;AM for their invaluable
						contributions to the Reserve Bank Board and thank them for their dedication and willingness to ensure
						continuity on the Governance Board.</p>
					<p>I also welcome the agreement of current members of the Reserve Bank Board to continue to serve on the
						Monetary Policy Board.</p>
					<p>I am looking forward to working with Marnie Baker and Renee Fry-McKibbin. Their expertise and insights
						will be vital as we continue our efforts to bring inflation back to target.</p>
					<p>The new members appointed to the Governance Board, Swati Dave, Danny Gilbert&nbsp;AM, David Thodey&nbsp;AO
						and Jennifer Westacott&nbsp;AO, will greatly assist the RBA in supporting and overseeing management as we
						continue to transform the organisation.</p>
