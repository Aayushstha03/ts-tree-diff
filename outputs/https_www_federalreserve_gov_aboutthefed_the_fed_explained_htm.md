The 11th edition of _The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does_ (formerly _The Federal Reserve System Purposes & Functions_) details the structure, responsibilities, and work of the U.S. central banking system.

It includes three key entities: the Board of Governors, 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee.
