The 11th edition of _The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does_ (formerly _The Federal Reserve System Purposes & Functions_) details the structure, responsibilities, and work of the U.S. central banking system. The Federal Reserve System performs five functions to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and, more generally, to serve the public interest. It includes three key entities: the Board of Governors, 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee.
