		<h2 id="toc2">1 Introduction</h2>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">This </strong><strong class="intense-emphasis">article uses a suite of
				models to analyse the macroeconomic impact of higher government defence spending.</strong>In June 2025
			members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) committed to increase core defence and other
			related spending by a volume unprecedented in recent history. In light of this pledge, we revisit the size
			of fiscal multipliers and their determinants across a range of ECB macroeconomic models. This article
			complements previous ECB analyses by highlighting the role of model differences in the quantification of
			economic effects of public spending.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Simulations are conducted around an increase in government consumption from
				2% of GDP in 2024 to 3% of GDP by 2028 that illustrates a stylised expansion of defence-related
				purchases (Chart 1).</strong><sup>[<a href="#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup> The increase begins in
			2025, reaches its peak by early 2028 and remains at this higher level for ten years, after which it
			gradually returns to its original level.</p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Using alternative model settings makes it possible to explore the
				determinants of fiscal multipliers and inflation estimates.</strong> This article looks at the effects
			of public spending increases on macroeconomic variables under a benchmark setting before studying the
			transmission under alternative specifications. It shows (i) the importance of private sector expectations
			about future financial market developments and deficit financing; (ii) the distributional aspects of
			increased government spending; and (iii) the extent of intra-euro area spillovers, which in turn vary
			depending on the instrument used or the origin of imports. The model-based assessment is complemented by Box
			1, which puts the model-based results into perspective by providing an overview of fiscal multipliers in the
			relevant empirical literature on defence spending.</p>

		<h2 id="toc3">2 Benchmarking fiscal multipliers across models</h2>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">To cover a wide range of transmission channels, the analysis uses both
				semi-structural and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models developed at the ECB.</strong>
			The semi-structural models employed include core projection models, namely the ECB-MC model (Angelini et
			al., forthcoming) and its euro area counterpart, ECB-BASE (Angelini et al., 2019 and Bańkowski, 2023). We
			also use a version of the latter that incorporates forward-looking expectations: ECB-REBASE (Adjemian et
			al., 2024). In addition, we employ two DSGE models. The first is an extended version of the ECB’s NAWM-E
			model (Coenen et al., 2024), which incorporates a global and regionally disaggregated structure.<sup>[<a
					href="#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup> The second, which is a newly developed model with household
			heterogeneity – a so-called Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian model, or HANK model (see Kase and Rigato,
			2025) – allows us to capture distributional effects more explicitly. We introduce the same government
			purchase shock into all models and harmonise the simulation modalities to the extent possible. Importantly,
			monetary policy is assumed to be active across all simulations.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.4"
					id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">The average output multiplier of government spending across models is 0.93
				over a two-year horizon, although there is substantial heterogeneity.</strong> Chart 2 shows the GDP
			multiplier and the impact on GDP growth and HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) inflation for each
			model. The multipliers shown here are within the range of those in the empirical literature (Box 1).
			Overall, semi-structural models display higher multipliers than DSGE models. This mostly owes to (i) the
			absence of expectation channels regarding the financing of the resulting deficit through taxation in the
			benchmark setting, and (ii) the smaller effects of interest rates on consumption decisions. By contrast, in
			DSGE models, the additional spending is necessarily financed with a mix of debt and taxes, which leads to
			stronger crowding-out owing to the effects of taxation on private sector expectations of future disposable
			income. Semi-structural models also tend to display a weaker role for monetary policy stabilisation. On the
			contrary, DSGE models feature strong inter-temporal reallocation via the real interest rate channel. The
			nominal-side transmission also differs depending on the properties of the model, with the HANK model
			displaying stronger effects on HICP inflation, mostly because inflation is more sensitive to economic cost
			pressures in the parameterisation used. The global and regional extension of NAWM-E shows weaker effects,
			and semi-structural forecast models fall somewhere in between. Given the numerous model-specific
			characteristics that affect the size of the fiscal multiplier, the following sections explore how the
			transmission mechanism of government spending can vary when relevant channels are altered.</p>

		<h2 id="toc4">3 The role of expectations: anticipating financial market responses and future disposable income
		</h2>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Private sector expectations can greatly influence the macroeconomic effects
				of increased government spending.</strong> To understand this interaction, we compare the predictions of
			two models with different assumptions regarding the expectations formations mechanism. The first model
			(ECB-BASE) assumes backward-looking expectations. Generally speaking, this implies that economic agents form
			their expectations on the basis of historical regularities and past information only. By contrast, the
			second model (ECB-REBASE) assumes that agents are forward-looking and incorporate news about future shocks
			and economic developments into their current decisions. This expectation formation mechanism is called
			model-consistent expectations.</p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Stronger forward-looking behaviour leads to an earlier and faster increase
				in financing rates, with an adverse impact on investment, but may stimulate consumption via households’
				expectations of higher future income.</strong><sup>[<a href="#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup> Chart 3
			compares the macroeconomic response with backward-looking (blue lines) and forward-looking (yellow lines)
			expectations with unchanged tax rates. Under backward-looking expectations, there is consumption and
			investment crowding-in as the economy gradually becomes aware of the demand and income impulse, with
			financial conditions tightening only gradually. Under the forward-looking setting, expectations of future
			policy rate hikes are reflected in long-term interest rates sooner, and the resulting worsening of borrowing
			conditions adversely affects investment dynamics over the shorter horizon. Generally, consumption decisions
			are also affected by tighter borrowing conditions, albeit to a much lesser extent than investment decisions.
			Instead, consumption increases on account of higher expected income.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.6"
					id="fn6">6</a>]</sup> The prospects of higher income in the future are anticipated in the
			forward-looking model, which leads to stronger consumption dynamics. In both the BASE and the REBASE model
			specifications, private consumption and investment are estimated to be crowded out over the longer run as
			the effects of higher production and incomes start to fade and the financial market tightening causes the
			economy to contract. Anticipation of the spending pattern in the forward-looking model also leads to mild
			frontloading in price and wage setting dynamics and, in turn, to a somewhat faster increase in HICP
			inflation.</p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">The output multiplier is considerably lower if the public deficit is
				expected to be financed through an increase in labour taxes.</strong> The red and green lines in Chart 3
			show specifications where the budget deficit is financed via an increase in taxes on labour income, which
			introduces an anticipation of future tax hikes at the onset of the increase in military spending. Two
			financing assumptions for the deficit are shown: a partial tax-financing scheme that still leads to a mild
			increase in public debt and an illustrative extreme case of full financing via higher taxes. In the
			forward-looking model, households internalise the repercussions for their future disposable income streams
			and strongly curtail their current consumption. Despite lower price pressures being somewhat beneficial for
			investment owing to rather limited changes to financial indicators, the bulk of the output multiplier is
			determined by consumption dynamics. As a result, output multipliers are dampened considerably.</p>

		<h2 id="toc5">4 Distributional consequences and the role of marginal propensities to consume</h2>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">This section explores the distributional aspects of the fiscal
				stimulus.</strong> It employs the HANK model, which features heterogenous households with large and
			dispersed marginal propensities to consume (MPCs). As is typical in this class of model, and in line with
			empirical evidence, households at the bottom of the income distribution have higher MPCs than those at the
			top. Like in the other models, an increase in government spending is associated with an increase in real
			GDP, despite a crowding-out effect on private consumption. The blue lines on Chart 4 show the implications
			of the fiscal shock under a benchmark specification of the HANK model. Private consumption and investment
			are significantly crowded out owing to both higher interest rates and higher labour taxes.</p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">The effects of fiscal policy are amplified when the additional government
				spending is targeted towards sectors that employ low-income households.</strong> The red lines on Chart
			4 show the results under this alternative specification. Since MPCs are negatively correlated with income,
			in this case the additional spending generates an additional stimulus to private consumption. In contrast to
			the benchmark specification, there is initially a slight crowding-in effect on private consumption.
			Consequently, HICP inflation is higher than in the benchmark, as are short-term interest rates. This
			generates a larger crowding-out of private investment, but the fiscal multiplier remains higher than in the
			benchmark specification.</p>

			Each line corresponds to a different group of households in terms of wealth holdings. There is a clear
			pattern: households at the bottom of the wealth distribution increase consumption, whereas consumption at
			the middle and top is crowded out. Since MPCs are larger at the bottom, the increase in labour demand and
			wages coming from the additional government spending tends to stimulate consumption for those households. At
			the middle and top of the wealth distribution, higher interest rates and expectations of higher future taxes
			play a larger role, leading to the observed crowding-out.</p>

		<h2 id="toc6">5 Backloaded versus frontloaded spending</h2>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">This section explores how fiscal multipliers vary when additional government
				spending is announced in advance of its implementation.</strong> This is particularly relevant in the
			case of the current defence-related commitments, as these have been publicly announced and discussed well in
			advance of the actual spending, which materialises over a longer period. In contrast to social transfers
			that are related to automatic stabilisers, discretionary defence spending measures are backloaded and
			gradual.</p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Backloaded spending leads to substantially lower effects on real
				GDP.</strong> Chart 6 shows fiscal multipliers for pre-announced fiscal shocks in the REBASE and HANK
			models. Each point on the curve corresponds to the fiscal multiplier of a one-time increase in government
			consumption as a function of the number of quarters by which its announcement precedes its implementation.
			Notably, the spending increase is identical – only the implementation date changes. When agents are
			forward-looking, the fiscal multipliers decrease as the time between announcement and implementation
			increases. This is because the prospect of increases in taxes and interest rates owing to future increases
			in government expenditure leads to an immediate crowding-out of private spending.</p>

		<h2 id="toc7">6 Cross-country spillovers</h2>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">This section looks at the cross-country spillovers of government spending
				and how these can vary depending on key features of the spending.</strong> We first benchmark the
			effects through the lens of the ECB-MC model. Given the workhorse nature of this model, important
			parameters, such as the import content of government spending, are set to historical averages. We then
			consider alternative scenarios using the global and regional extension of NAWM-E to provide a more
			qualitative illustration from alternative sensitivity exercises.</p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Both government consumption and government investment generate positive
				domestic real effects, but the magnitude of spillovers across euro area countries varies depending on
				the import content of the instrument (Chart 7).</strong> Government consumption is assumed to rely
			mostly on domestic production, with an import share of only around 10%. By contrast, government investment
			has a much higher import share of around 30%.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup> As a result,
			in the short to medium run government consumption causes a stronger increase in domestic output than
			government investment, while spillover effects on other countries remain small – and even turn negative
			after three years – as the rise in policy rates outweighs the positive trade effects over the longer term.
			Conversely, government investment generates positive spillovers throughout the horizon, as it stimulates
			private investment and partially offsets the dampening effect of higher interest rates. </p>

		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">On the nominal side, government consumption and investment raise domestic
				inflation and generate inflationary spillovers across countries but do so in different ways.</strong>
			Government consumption is substantially more inflationary, as it directly increases demand without boosting
			productive capacity. By contrast, government investment raises inflation in the short term but, by
			strengthening trend productivity, also helps to ease price pressures over the medium term.</p>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Spillovers operate mainly through the trade channel and less so through
				interest rates, with the net effect on the euro area appearing limited in magnitude.</strong> Chart 8
			disentangles the transmission channels using the global extension of the NAWM-E model and shows that higher
			German public spending raises domestic demand, which initially boosts output. However, under the benchmark
			calibration, higher government demand crowds out private demand over time.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.8"
					id="fn8">8</a>]</sup> This is because stronger public demand puts upward pressure on prices and
			wages, raising the cost of borrowing and reducing households’ and firms’ real disposable income and
			profitability.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup> At the same time, the increased demand for
			imports improves the trade balance of Germany’s euro area partners, supporting their exports and output.
			However, as prices rise in Germany, the real exchange rate appreciates, which dampens German export
			competitiveness and increases imports further. This real appreciation partly offsets the boost to net
			exports for the rest of the euro area. For the euro area, the higher aggregate demand and price pressures
			push up inflation. In response, the central bank raises the policy rate negligibly, suggesting that the
			impact of this tightening on private consumption and investment – via the traditional interest rate channel
			– is likely to be limited.</p>

				defence spending: a short review of the empirical literature</h2>
			<p class="ecb-authors">Prepared by Cristina Checherita-Westphal and Laust Ladegård Særkjær</p>
			<p>Although the evidence is mixed across the empirical literature, it suggests that military spending can
				have positive short-term demand effects which then tend to decrease over time. This broadly confirms the
				model-based effects of the general government spending increase considered in this article, although
				results are more dispersed across samples and various state dependencies (Chart&nbsp;A). The size of the
				defence spending multiplier differs significantly across studies, with the shorter-run effects in most
				cases below or close to 1 – broadly in line with the suite of model results presented above – although
				values close to 1.5 are found in several studies. Very few studies directly analyse the impact of higher
				defence spending on private consumption.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup> Ilzetzki
				(2025), one of the most recent literature reviews, concludes that there is a consensus that GDP does
				increase following higher defence spending, but the degree of this expansion and the potential
				crowding-out of the private sector are debated. He also points out that two meta-analyses on the topic
				disagree on the conclusions. Alptekin and Levine (2012), a meta-study of 169 estimates of the military
				spending multiplier, suggests that military spending has positive, but small, growth effects.
				Conversely, the updated sample of F. Yesilyurt and M. E. Yesilyurt (2019) shows no relationship.
				Finally, in their meta-analysis of fiscal multipliers, Gechert and Rannenberg (2018) find that military
				spending tends to have lower average multipliers than general government spending,<sup>[<a
						href="#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup> a finding corroborated by a recent study analysing
				the output effects of defence spending in the central and eastern European members of NATO’s eastern
				flank (Olejnik, 2023).</p>
			<p>There is also considerable heterogeneity in the output effects of various components of military
				expenditure. The growth effects of military research and development (R&amp;D) spending are found to be
				considerably higher than those of other components and to exceed unity, with evidence of crowding-in of
				private R&amp;D.<sup>[<a href="#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup> For the other spending categories,
				and particularly over the medium to long run, higher defence expenditure is usually found to crowd out
				resources available for productive purposes. Expenditure on wages or military personnel (not directly
				covered in the model simulation results above) is found to have lower or (in the longer run) even
				negative growth effects, as such spending may impede productivity in the remaining civilian sectors of
				the economy (see Chart A and additional findings in Becker and Dunne, 2023).</p>

							military spending (news) as an instrument for more general government spending. For the
							United States, Ramey and Zubairy (2018) find the fiscal multiplier to be below one
							regardless of the slack in the economy. Using a large panel of countries, Sheremirov and
							Spirovska (2022) find that the average multiplier is below unity, with the largest impact at

			<p>Defence fiscal multipliers are found to be state-dependent. The empirical literature usually finds
				evidence of fiscal multipliers being larger (i) in recessions (bad economic times), when the share of
				non-Ricardian consumers tends to increase and public spending can crowd in (rather than crowd out)
				private investment; (ii) when there is ample fiscal space or sound public finances (lower debt, deficit
				or lower interest rate-growth differential); (iii) for less open economies (less potential for
				spillovers outside the economy through imports); and (iv) for fixed-exchange rate systems (inactive
				monetary policy) (see Warmedinger et al. (2015) for a review). Similar results are found for defence
				spending multipliers in Sarasa-Flores (2025) (Chart A) and in Sheremirov and Spirovska (2022) (for
				fiscal multipliers of general government spending instrumented by military spending). The importance of
				state dependency (non-linearities) for good versus bad economic times is also emphasised in the
				meta-analysis of Gechert and Rannenberg (2018). Together with fiscal fundamentals, state dependency is
				an important aspect to be considered in the (linear) model-based simulations. This can be done by
				adequately varying the model parameters depending on the prevailing state.</p>
			<p>Empirical studies of defence spending rarely investigate the effects on inflation directly. The few
				available studies for the United States tend to find a positive short-term effect. Ben Zeev and Pappa
				(2017) find military spending news to be inflationary, peaking after one year before returning to zero
				in year two. Looking at state-level effects on inflation of military spending, Nakamura and Steinsson
				(2014) find no cumulative effect after two years. More recently, Antonova et al. (2025) find that
				military spending news leads to higher manufacturing prices in the United States (while the impact on
				consumer price index inflation is not investigated). This effect was larger and more persistent in the
				post-Cold War period, when the US manufacturing sector shrank.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 id="toc9">7 Conclusion</h2>
		<p><strong class="intense-emphasis">Against the backdrop of planned increases in defence spending in the euro
				area, a model-based assessment of government spending shocks suggests a positive effect on real GDP
				growth and a modest effect on HICP inflation, with significant uncertainty surrounding
				estimates.</strong> A persistent but gradual increase in military spending of 1% of GDP over three years
			is associated with a two-year GDP multiplier of 0.93 and a two-year impact on HICP inflation of 0.07
			percentage points on average across different model types. There is substantial model heterogeneity, with
			output multipliers ranging from 0.42 to 1.13. Four years after the shock, the GDP multiplier remains at 0.93
			on average, while HICP inflation increases by 0.2 percentage points on average across the models.
			Model-implied fiscal multipliers are generally aligned with the empirical evidence on the effects of
			military spending. We further identify key transmission channels that shape the economic effect of
			additional military spending: a higher share of investment produces larger spillovers, whereas the private
			sector anticipating higher taxes and interest rates plays a prominent role in reducing multipliers. Several
			aspects remain outside the scope of this analysis, in particular state dependency with respect to government
			indebtedness and bad versus good economic times, which is found to be relevant in the empirical literature.
			Finally, important aspects of military spending cannot be fully captured in this analysis. Examples include
			the composition of spending by single countries or sectoral supply and industry-network effects.</p>

				<p> Most results in this article hold for increases in government spending of different magnitudes, as

					to increase core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP and to add further security-related spending of
					1.5% of GDP such that total defence-related spending amounts to 5% of GDP. This annual spending is
					set to be achieved by 2035. The spending pattern in our analysis is therefore a stylised

				<p> It is assumed that there is no sovereign risk premium response to an increase in public debt.
					Therefore, the analysis in this article abstracts from the possible implications of a higher and
					increasing level of debt in individual countries. We also abstract from the banking sector
					transmitting the easing of balance sheet constraints to borrowing conditions and, more generally,
					set any financing spreads to the baseline level. Therefore, in these simulations, only expectations
					about future policy rates affect long-term interest rates (expectation hypothesis), which are then
					allowed to change external financing rates (via composite interest rates with constant spreads). The
					term premium is fixed to its baseline value throughout all simulations. </p>

			<li id="footnote-7" data-footnote-id="fn6">
				<p> In addition to the anticipation of future labour income, another positive effect on consumption

				<p> These import shares are based on historical averages from Eurostat and reflect the entire set of

			</li>
			<li id="footnote-9" data-footnote-id="fn8">
				<p> When public and private consumption are perceived as complements, higher public spending – such as
					defence expenditure that enhances security and stability – can crowd in private consumption,
					boosting the aggregate demand channel and reinforcing positive spillovers to the rest of the euro
					area. </p>
			</li>
			<li id="footnote-10" data-footnote-id="fn9">
				<p> Arguably, the German fiscal surprise can be interpreted as reflecting a reassessment of heightened
					European security risks, with additional fiscal spending aimed at avoiding future demand losses that
					would occur without it rather than delivering a pure net gain. In this context, additional fiscal
					spending serves to preserve current consumption levels. </p>
			</li>
			<li id="footnote-11" data-footnote-id="fn10">
				<p> The simulations assume that German government consumption good is produced with a higher share of
					imports – both from the rest of the euro area and the rest of the world – in proportion to its
					bilateral trade matrix. In particular, the import content of government consumption is doubled from
					2% to 4%. Altering the composition of imports for Germany (e.g. by importing relatively more from
					the rest of the euro area than from the rest of the world) produces a stronger spillover to the rest
					of the euro area as a result of a strengthened trade channel. However, given the overall small
					import content of public spending and the small size of the fiscal impulse, the net difference to
					the euro area aggregate is negligible. </p>
			</li>
			<li id="footnote-12" data-footnote-id="fn11">
				<p> Only three of the studies summarised in Chart A include estimates of the impact on private
					consumption. Ramey (2011) includes a specific discussion on the topic. By constructing a military
					spending news variable, she finds that both non-durable goods consumption and durable goods
					consumption decrease, while services consumption increases in response to military spending news.
					Ben Zeev and Pappa (2017) find a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in private
					consumption. Barro and Redlick (2011) find a negative impact only for durable goods consumption at
					the one-year horizon, which then fades. </p>
			</li>
			<li id="footnote-13" data-footnote-id="fn12">
				<p> This finding holds on average and for expansionary periods. Conversely, military spending

			<li id="footnote-14" data-footnote-id="fn13">
				<p> Using data for the United States over a period of 125 years (with a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive
					(BVAR) model with long lags), Antolin-Diaz and Surico (2025) find that military spending has large
					and persistent effects on output because it shifts the composition of public spending towards
					R&amp;D. This boosts innovation and private investment in the medium term and increases productivity
					and GDP at longer horizons. By contrast, the paper also finds that public investment effects are
					shorter-lived and public consumption has a modest impact at most horizons </p>
