The Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) has today released an Issues Paper: [Review into Small and Medium-sized Banks](/publications/consultations/2024/review-into-small-and-medium-sized-banks/review-into-small-and-medium-sized-banks.html).

The Treasurer asked the CFR, in consultation with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), to examine the state of the small and medium-sized banking sector, with a focus on competition (see [Terms of Reference](https://treasury.gov.au/review/small-and-medium-sized-banks-review/terms-of-reference)).

The Review’s purpose is to consider and report to Government on options and approaches to improving competition in the small and medium-sized banking sector. The CFR is seeking feedback and evidence from stakeholders on the issues facing the small and medium-sized banking sector and how these could be addressed.

Written submissions to the Issues Paper are requested by 7 February 2025. Submissions should be sent to: [CFRReview@treasury.gov.au](mailto:CFRReview@treasury.gov.au).
