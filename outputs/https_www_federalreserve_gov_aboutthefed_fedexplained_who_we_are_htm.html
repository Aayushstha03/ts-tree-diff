<p>The Federal Reserve is the U.S. central bank, <span data-marker-content="img1">created</span> by the <strong>Federal Reserve Act</strong> of 1913 to establish a monetary system that could respond effectively to stresses in the banking system. The Federal Reserve System includes</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Board of Governors, a federal agency located in Washington, D.C., and</li>
	<li>12 Federal Reserve Banks around the nation.</li>
</ul>

It conducts the nation’s monetary policy, promotes financial system stability, supervises and regulates financial institutions, fosters payment and settlement system safety and efficiency, and promotes consumer protection and community development.</p>

<h2 data-marker-content="img10">Twelve Operating Arms around Our Nation</h2>
<p>The <strong>12 Reserve Banks</strong>—and their 24 Branches—are <strong>the operating arms of the Federal Reserve System</strong>. Each Reserve Bank operates within its own particular geographic area, or district, of the United States.</p>
<p>Although supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, the Reserve Banks operate independently in many respects. The Reserve Banks carry out a number of core Fed functions, such as</p>
<ul>
	<li>supervising and examining banks and other financial institutions;</li>
	<li>enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws while promoting local community development; and</li>
	<li>lending to depository institutions to ensure liquidity in the financial system.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also play a key role in another primary Fed function—fostering the safety and efficiency of our nation's payment systems, including</p>
<ul>
	<li>distributing currency and coins to banks, operating electronic payment systems, and clearing our checks; and</li>
	<li>acting as the "government's bank" by providing services such as maintaining the Treasury Department's transaction account and issuing and redeeming U.S. government securities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Reserve Banks also provide a wealth of information on conditions across the nation—information that is vital to formulating a national monetary policy that helps maintain a healthy U.S. economy and stable financial system.</p>

<h2>A Federal Committee Setting the Nation's Monetary Policy</h2>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, or <strong>FOMC</strong>, is a 12-person group of Federal Reserve System officials that <strong>sets crucial U.S. monetary policy at meetings held at least 8 times each year.</strong></p>
</div>
<div data-marker-content="img12">
<p>The FOMC's monetary policy actions influence interest rates and credit conditions, which can significantly impact financial conditions, including economic productivity and even spending and investment decisions by households, communities, and businesses.</p>
<p>The FOMC makes all decisions regarding the appropriate position or "stance" of monetary policy to help move the economy toward the congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.</p>
</div>
<div data-marker-content="img13">
<p>The FOMC's 12 voting members include</p>
<ul>
	<li>the 7 members of the Board of Governors;</li>
	<li>the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and</li>
	<li>4 of the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, all the remaining 7 Reserve Bank presidents attend FOMC meetings and participate in FOMC deliberations.</p>

</div>
</div><p>The Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee work together to promote the health of the U.S. economy and the stability of the U.S. financial system.</p><div id="research">
<h2>Tuned in to Economic Conditions through Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
<p>Teams of economists, analysts, examiners, and other professionals from across the Federal Reserve System <strong>continuously gather and analyze data and information</strong> from around the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>This information and analysis provides insights on conditions across the nation—including at the regional and local level—that are vital to</p>
<ul>
	<li>formulating effective monetary policy,</li>
	<li>assessing the health of the U.S. economy,</li>
	<li>promoting the stability of our financial system, and</li>
	<li>ensuring that consumer, community, and business voices are heard at the central bank.</li>
</ul>
