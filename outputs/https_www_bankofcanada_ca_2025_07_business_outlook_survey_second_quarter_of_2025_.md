Tariff impacts have materialized, but expectations for future impacts have eased
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tariffs and trade tensions continue to weigh on the outlooks of many firms. In some cases, the negative effects on costs and sales that most businesses predicted last quarter have materialized, and firms expect them to persist.

At the same time, firms have moderated their expectations for negative impacts, as the worst-case trade scenarios they anticipated last quarter now appear less likely ([Chart 1](#chart1)). For example, around two-thirds of firms expected higher tariff-related costs last quarter compared with only one-third this quarter.

Weak demand is broad-based
--------------------------

Firms’ near-term sales expectations weakened in the second quarter of 2025. The balance of opinion on indicators of future sales has turned negative as tariff-related impacts have materialized. More firms reported their indicators (e.g., order books, advance bookings and sales inquiries) have deteriorated compared with 12 months ago than those that reported their indicators have improved ([Chart 3](#chart3)). This weakness is largely driven by broad spillover effects from the trade conflict, such as:

*   weak spending on services and capital goods by business customers
*   low consumer spending or concerns that consumers could start to spend less
*   weak outlooks in the housing sector
*   soft sales outlooks among oil and gas firms because of downward pressure on global oil prices

For exporters, weakness in near-term sales indicators partly reflects the pull-forward of exports earlier in the year before tariffs were imposed, which was followed by a slowdown because clients had already stocked up on goods.

Plans to expand capacity are still on hold
------------------------------------------

Most firms reported that both their physical capacity and workforce size are sufficient. The share of firms that would have difficulty meeting an unexpected increase in demand remains below its historical average ([Chart 5](#chart5), yellow line). There is little evidence that firms are facing supply chain difficulties restricting their ability to meet demand or that they are experiencing difficulties sourcing critical inputs. Businesses said they can find workers more easily now than at the same time last year, and the share of firms that reported having labour shortages remains below average ([Chart 5](#chart5), green line).
