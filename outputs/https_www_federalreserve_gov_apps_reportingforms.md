The Federal Reserve uses reporting forms to collect data from bank holding companies, depository institutions, other financial and nonfinancial entities, and consumers. Use of the forms is required in some cases, voluntary in others. Forms and instructions on this website may be reproduced for use by respondents.([More about reporting forms](/apps/reportingforms/home/about))

Forms used exclusively by the Federal Reserve have numbers preceded by the letters FR; those used by other federal banking agencies as well as the Federal Reserve have numbers preceded by the letters FFIEC (for Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council).
