					<p>We sit here at a time of strength for securitisation in Australia; 2024 has emerged as the strongest year
						for issuance in over a decade, relative to the size of the economy (Graph&nbsp;1).<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1" aria-label="Go to endnote 1">[1]</a></sup> The
						market has been underpinned by strong investor demand, which has driven spreads lower despite high
						issuance.</p>

					</div>
					<p>Today I will take a step back to do a bit of a stocktake, covering why securitisation continues to matter
						to the economy, how the market has evolved over the past decade or so, and whether we should be worried
						about any systemic risks related to securitisation markets.</p>
					<p>To get to the punchline – securitisation is evolving. It remains a stable source of funding for
						credit, and has shifted in three interesting and important ways: issuance has increasingly come from
						non-banks; the composition of borrowers has broadened toward those with less access to bank credit; and
						we hear from liaison that investor demand is supported by increased participation from foreign investors.
					</p>
					<p>What should we make of these developments? Again, three observations:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>First, they have allowed more households and businesses to borrow, especially some that have less
							access to credit from more traditional lenders (such as those who can’t easily provide the usual
							income verification and for vehicle financing). In this sense, the securitisation market continues to
							be a flexible source of market-based funding that supports a diversity of lenders in the Australian
							financial system. That is valuable for competition and innovation in the market for household and
							business lending.</li>
						<li>Second, this shift amid favourable market conditions has given rise to the potential for some risk to
							build up in the system, leaving it a little more vulnerable to a shock. In particular, in servicing a
							broader group of borrowers, non-bank lenders have increased some types of higher-risk lending.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2" aria-label="Go to endnote 2">[2]</a></sup> But
							in other ways risk exposures have declined, and overall there are limited signs of strain among
							borrowers so far. That in part reflects the resilience of the labour market, which has supported both
							household and business borrowers. More generally, any risks to the broader financial system remain
							contained by the small size of the non-bank sector.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3" aria-label="Go to endnote 3">[3]</a></sup></li>
						<li>Finally, there is an interesting picture around investor demand. There may be a cyclical element to
							the strength in demand which could turn if global financial conditions were to deteriorate,
							particularly with risk premiums compressed in many markets. But there also appears to have been a
							broader, structural deepening across different parts of the Australian domestic bond market. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Having given the headlines, I’ll now turn to each of those themes.</p>
					<h2>1. A stable source of funding</h2>
					<p>Securitisation has been a resilient source of funding for credit provision in the Australian economy over
						recent years. Securitisation helps to fund loans to Australian households and businesses, by packaging up
						those loans and selling them to investors as marketable securities. As you can see on this graph, the
						share of housing credit funded by securitisation has been broadly stable at around 6&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
						over the past decade (Graph&nbsp;2). That is much lower than just before the global financial crisis
						(GFC), but the steep increase in securitised credit in that period was of course highly unusual.</p>
					<div>
						<figure>

							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-so-2024-12-02-graph02.svg" alt="Graph 2: A line graph showing the share of housing credit funded by securitisation. The graph shows that the share peaked in 2007 and fell rapidly following the Global Financial Crisis. The share has been stable at around 6 per cent since 2016." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>So at this high level, it’s been a remarkably steady period. The resilience in securitisation in
						recent years is quite striking when we consider the headwinds that issuers have faced.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4" aria-label="Go to endnote 4">[4]</a></sup></p>
					<p>First, rising interest rates since 2022 have tended to make wholesale sources of funds such as
						securitisation less competitive compared with deposits (Graph&nbsp;3). This is in part because not all
						types of deposits pay interest and also because deposit funding tends to reprice at a slower pace than
						funding from securitisation.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5" aria-label="Go to endnote 5">[5]</a></sup></p>
					<div>
						<figure>

							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-so-2024-12-02-graph03.svg" alt="Graph 3: A line graph showing outstanding bank funding costs by component. The graph shows that bank funding costs have increased since 2022 for all components, with funding costs from securitisation increasing more significantly compared to deposit funding costs. " width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Another potential headwind to securitisation markets recently has been the resumption of bank bond
						issuance with the end of the Term Funding Facility (TFF). There was some question over whether the
						rebound in bank bond issuance would crowd out demand for asset-backed securities (ABS). This crowding out
						has not eventuated so far, with issuance in the ABS market remaining strong. I’ll come back to the
						reasons for this later.</p>
					<h2>2. A broadening market</h2>
					<p>So how has the market remained so resilient? One factor has been the flexibility in securitisation
						business models, which has seen some important changes in the shape of the market.</p>
					<p>In particular, in recent years we’ve seen a lot more lenders entering the market – particularly
						non-banks (Graph&nbsp;4). The number of non-banks issuing ABS in Australia has risen four-fold from a
						decade ago.</p>
					<div>
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<p><span>Graph 4</span></p>
							</figcaption>
							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-so-2024-12-02-graph04.svg" alt="Graph 4: A graph with lines showing the number of ABS issuers each year, split by banks and non-banks. The graph shows that there has been a sharp increase in the number of non-bank issuers, from around 15 in 2019 to 40 in 2024. The number of bank issuers has been fairly stable in the last decade." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>As a result, non-banks have accounted for most ABS issuance in recent years and much of the growth in the
						market in that time (Graph&nbsp;5). Securitisation is a particularly important source of funding for
						non-bank lenders, given they can’t raise deposits. For example, residential mortgage-backed
						securities (RMBS) make up an estimated three-quarters of funding for Australian non-bank mortgage
						lenders. That said, securitisation also provides banks more diversity in their funding sources and access
						to a wider range of investors, particularly for smaller banks.</p>
					<div>
						<figure>

The graph shows a steady increase in issuance in the lead up to the Global Financial Crisis, led by banks, followed by a period of lower issuance from all issuer types from 2008 to 2016. The third panel shows that issuance volumes have increased over the past couple of years to levels observed prior to the Global Financial Crisis, mostly driven by non-bank lenders." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>This growing role of non-banks within securitisation is not unique to Australia. It is seen in some other
						advanced economies and reflects a range of factors from regulatory reform since the GFC through to
						demographics.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6" aria-label="Go to endnote 6">[6]</a></sup></p>
					<p>This shift toward non-banks in the Australian market is closely tied to flexibility in non-banks’
						business models. We can see how this flexibility has played out in residential mortgages. These are still
						the staple of the Australian ABS market, with RMBS accounting for three-quarters of the ABS market.</p>
					<p>The next graph shows the effect that non-banks have had on the mortgages underlying the RMBS market
						(Graph&nbsp;6). Let me step through this. Here we are comparing the characteristics of the mortgages that
						underlie <cite>marketed</cite> RMBS (those sold publicly to investors, orange lines) with loans that
						banks have <cite>self-securitised</cite> (structured assets created by banks to use exclusively as
						collateral to access liquidity from the RBA, blue lines). These self-securitisations tend to closely
						reflect the banks’ overall mortgage portfolio along important dimensions.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7" aria-label="Go to endnote 7">[7]</a></sup> This
						comparison is made possible by the data from our Securitisation Database.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8" aria-label="Go to endnote 8">[8]</a></sup></p>
					<div>

							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-so-2024-12-02-graph06.svg" alt="Graph 6: A four-panel line graph showing mortgage characteristics underlying marketed RMBS and self-securitisation pool. The top left panel shows that the share of marketed RMBS that are investor loans has increased since 2016, as opposed to a gradual declining trend of the investor share within self-securitised bank loans. The top right panel shows that the interest-only share has decreased more sharply within the self-securitisation pool than marketed RMBS. The bottom left panel shows that the share of marketed RMBS loans that are low- or alt-doc loans has increased significantly, whereas the low- and alt-doc share in self-securitised loans has remained low. The bottom right panel shows that the share of loans with a LVR greater than 80 per cent has declined since 2019 and has been broadly similar for marketed and self-securitised RMBS.  " width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>So this is broadly comparing the characteristics of mortgages funded in the securitisation market with
						those funded by the banks.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="r9" aria-label="Go to endnote 9">[9]</a></sup></p>
					<p>The key takeaway here is that residential mortgages that are funded by securitisation have shifted toward
						investor loans and low- or alternative-documentation loans (which require less or alternative
						verification of income or assets).<sup><a href="#fn10" id="r10" aria-label="Go to endnote 10">[10]</a></sup> You can see this in the left-hand panels. This
						mostly reflects non-banks’ increased share of the market, as they target their lending more towards
						these segments than banks. But non-banks have also increased their share of these types of lending within
						their portfolios over time.</p>
					<p>At the same time, banks’ broader mortgage portfolios have shifted a little away from low-/alt-doc and
						investor loans (the blue lines on Graph&nbsp;6).<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11" aria-label="Go to endnote 11">[11]</a></sup></p>
					<p>So securitisation has broadened toward some household borrowers who might have less access to credit from
						traditional lenders. That is a long-running trend that started before the rise in interest rates, and has
						indeed has stabilised a bit of late.</p>
					<p>As I’ll come to below, on the surface that might also suggest a shift to riskier loan segments. But
						it’s also worth pointing out there has been shift away from high-loan-to-valuation (LVR) lending and
						interest-only lending – which would work to reduce risks, and you can see this change in the
						right-hand panels. We’ve seen a similar shift in the broader banking system.</p>
					<p>Looking beyond residential mortgages, we again see that the securitisation market has extended credit to a
						wider range of borrowers, against a wider range of collateral.</p>
					<p>Non-bank lenders in particular have extended their presence to areas such as vehicle and equipment
						lending, and some lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Again, these are areas less serviced by
						traditional finance. Securitisation of loans for vehicles has grown quickly in recent years
						(Graph&nbsp;7), partly from non-bank securitisers taking over existing vehicle loan books after several
						banks withdrew from auto financing in 2021.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="r12" aria-label="Go to endnote 12">[12]</a></sup></p>
					<p>While there has been a lot of recent focus on this strong growth in ‘other’ ABS, these are
						currently still very small numbers in the scheme of overall credit. For example, business credit from
						non-bank lenders that fund themselves mostly through securitisation accounts for around
						1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of overall business credit.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="r13" aria-label="Go to endnote 13">[13]</a></sup></p>

The graph suggests that issuance of auto and equipment ABS has grown in recent years. This is consistent with strong credit growth for auto lenders. " width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>What explains this flexibility on the part of the non-banks? Non-banks tend to focus more on certain parts
						of the lending market where banks have more limited risk appetite – those differences in risk
						appetite reflects several factors, including prudential capital requirements. Non-banks are not directly
						bound by the same prudential requirements as banks, precisely because they do not take deposits.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="r14" aria-label="Go to endnote 14">[14]</a></sup> As a
						result, they have more flexibility to extend loans based on their business models and risk appetite
						around lending standards.</p>
					<p>Banks do set limits on the risk metrics of the loans funded through the warehouse facilities they provide
						non-banks. But non-banks still have greater flexibility in extending credit.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="r15" aria-label="Go to endnote 15">[15]</a></sup></p>
					<p>In all, this changing shape of the securitisation market speaks to some of the potentially beneficial
						roles it can play in the Australian financial system. Securitisation provides market-based funding to a
						diverse range of lenders that, in turn, provide important competition to bank-based financing and reach
						some households and businesses with more limited access to traditional bank credit.</p>
					<h2>3. The flipside of a broader securitisation market</h2>
					<p>I’ll now turn to possible risks.</p>
					<p>Strong demand for ABS is good news for both ABS issuers and borrowers. But any increase in risk appetite
						may also come with risks to investors and the broader system.</p>
					<p>To date, the performance of underlying collateral has underpinned the strength in the Australian
						securitisation market. As you know, investors in rated Australian RMBS have never suffered credit losses
						from these investments.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="r16" aria-label="Go to endnote 16">[16]</a></sup> This is largely because losses on the underlying
						loans have been extremely low, and are typically covered by available income remaining in the mortgage
						pool after required payments have been made.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="r17" aria-label="Go to endnote 17">[17]</a></sup></p>
					<p>Our assessment a few years ago had been that loans funded through securitisation appeared to be no riskier
						than the broader population of mortgages on some key measures.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="r18" aria-label="Go to endnote 18">[18]</a></sup> But as I’ve just shown,
						there have been some shifts toward different types of borrowers, which warrants revisiting this view.</p>
					<p>So what do we see? So far, arrears rates for mortgages underlying marketed RMBS seem to be very similar to
						that of mortgages extended by banks (Graph&nbsp;8). As you would expect at this stage of the economic
						cycle, arrears rates have risen. But they are not high from a historical or international
						perspective.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="r19" aria-label="Go to endnote 19">[19]</a></sup> So at this stage, it’s not obvious that the
						relative risks of RMBS have shifted noticeably.</p>
					<div>
						<figure>

							<img src="/speeches/2024/images/sp-so-2024-12-02-graph08.svg" alt="Graph 8: A graph with lines showing the share of ADI loans and loans underlying marketed RMBS that are in 90+ day arrears. The lines tend to move closely together over the sample from 2016 to 2024, and have both increased slightly from the low levels observed in 2022, to be around their pre-COVID levels." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>We have a good picture here of mortgage arrears. But it’s harder to see how business loans in ABS are
						performing. That’s because while we can get great insights into mortgage arrears from our
						Securitisation Database, data on non-bank lenders’ business lending is limited. I understand that
						the ASF has been working to standardise data reporting for SME lending, to better support investors in
						managing their exposures to these products. This is where liaison information from you is also
						particularly useful – we hear that stress is emerging in some areas of business lending, including
						in the construction sector and for borrowers with relatively low credit ratings for vehicle
						financing.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="r20" aria-label="Go to endnote 20">[20]</a></sup> But these areas of stress are small and isolated,
						and lenders generally do not expect them to become more widespread at this stage.</p>
					<p>This is of course not to downplay the pressures felt across the community from high inflation and
						restrictive monetary policy. Even though the share of borrowers that are experiencing severe financial
						stress remains small, many households and businesses continue to experience pressure on their budgets.
						This has been a consistent area of focus in our <cite>Financial Stability Review </cite> publication.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="r21" aria-label="Go to endnote 21">[21]</a></sup></p>
					<p>The performance of the underlying loans will affect ABS investors differently, given that the distribution
						of risk depends on specific portfolio choices. Investors themselves should be well placed to test how
						their investments would behave under different scenarios. Investors in RMBS tend to be sophisticated and
						we could expect them to be well placed to understand and manage the risks arising from these
						investments.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="r22" aria-label="Go to endnote 22">[22]</a></sup></p>
					<p>As a central bank, however, we are interested not only in the risks borne by individual investors and
						lenders – we also have a responsibility to monitor potential risks from a system-wide perspective.
						A buoyant securitisation market could mean a shift into riskier lending for the system as a whole.</p>
					<p>The key point I want to reiterate is that risks from non-bank lenders are currently somewhat limited by
						the small size of the sector, limited connections to the rest of the financial system, and their funding
						being sourced mainly from sophisticated investors.</p>
					<p>But markets evolve, and it is worth monitoring a number of risks. One thing we monitor is banks’
						exposure to non-bank securitisers through warehouse facilities. This exposure remains very low, at around
						1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of bank assets. Banks also impose lending standards for the loans originated in
						warehouses they fund, in line with their own risk appetite and APRA’s capital requirements, with
						RMBS reporting requirements further enforcing discipline on loan quality.</p>
					<p>If economic conditions were to worsen, there are also important mitigants against any systemic risks
						arising from non-banks’ mortgage lending. These points were discussed more broadly in our most
						recent <cite>Financial Stability Review</cite>. First and foremost is the resilience of households,
						supported by a robust labour market and sizeable savings buffers.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="r23" aria-label="Go to endnote 23">[23]</a></sup> The vast majority of borrowers
						also have a lot of equity in their homes thanks to prudent lending standards and the increase in housing
						prices over a number of years, which limits the risks to the financial system. Very few loans in arrears
						are estimated to be in negative equity (indeed we saw this a moment ago with the low levels of high-LVR
						loans). While selling a property is usually a last resort and a very disruptive solution for borrowers in
						financial difficulty, almost all borrowers in this situation would be able to repay their loans in
						full.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="r24" aria-label="Go to endnote 24">[24]</a></sup></p>
					<p>So while there has been a potential for risk to build up, there are limited signs of strain so far and in
						any event it would be quite contained.</p>
					<h2>4. Strong investor demand – cyclical and structural</h2>
					<p>So far, I have focused on the issuers of ABS, and the ultimate borrowers whose loans are funded by those
						securitisations. But there has also been an important evolution in terms of the investor base in ABS.</p>
					<p>Rewinding to 2023, a major question mark over the market was how investor demand might respond to banks
						resuming bond issuance in the lead up to the end of the TFF. During the pandemic and with the TFF in
						place, there was very little bank bond issuance. That saw investors shift into ABS as a substitute, and
						ABS issuance by non-banks increased rapidly (the shaded area in Graph&nbsp;9).<sup><a href="#fn25" id="r25" aria-label="Go to endnote 25">[25]</a></sup> A
						question that some people asked last year was whether an expected rebound in bank issuance would crowd
						out ABS demand. But this crowding out has not eventuated, with issuance in the ABS market continuing to
						be strong even as banks have returned to wholesale funding markets.</p>
					<div>

						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>The strength of investor demand has meant that pricing has been tight even while there has been record
						issuance. Tighter pricing has been particularly noticeable for the riskier tranches, with the gap between
						the highest-rated prime RMBS and mezzanine tranches near its decade-low (Graph&nbsp;10).</p>

						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>A key message we hear is that offshore investors have contributed, at least in part, to the strength of
						demand. Market commentary suggests that around half of RMBS orders have been from offshore accounts in
						the first three quarters of 2024.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="r26" aria-label="Go to endnote 26">[26]</a></sup> Foreign investor demand has been especially strong
						for riskier tranches. That said, foreign ownership of ABS has been relatively stable for some time
						(Graph&nbsp;11).</p>
					<div>
						<figure>
							<figcaption>

The graph shows foreign ownership of ABS peaked in 2007 and has been relatively stable since 2019." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Our liaison meetings suggest that some of you are concerned about how persistent this foreign demand may
						prove. Indeed, narrowing in risk premia is not unique to the securitisation market – we have also
						seen compressed risk premiums in other markets for risk assets. The equity risk premium at around its
						lowest level in a few decades and spreads on non-financial corporate bonds have tightened this year.</p>
					<p>The RBA’s recent <cite>Financial Stability Review </cite> pointed to low risk premiums globally as a
						potential vulnerability for Australian markets. They potentially leave global asset prices sensitive to a
						variety of potential shocks. That includes if expectations for a soft landing in the global economy were
						to come into question.</p>
					<p>That said, if we look over a longer horizon there do also appear to be structural factors supporting
						demand. We see that in other segments of the domestic Australian bond market as well. If we zoom out for
						a moment from ABS to look at the broader fixed-income market, a consistent message we’ve heard from
						liaison is the development of the domestic bond market in recent years, across a range of sectors.</p>
					<p>We see that, for example, in corporate bonds (and I’m using the broad definition of that here –
						financials and non-financials). Australian companies issue a similar volume of bonds offshore as they did
						a decade ago, and at that time most of their issuance was offshore. But their bond issuance in Australia
						has doubled in that time, and they now issue almost as much in Australia as they do abroad
						(Graph&nbsp;12). There has been a cyclical component to this. But liaison suggests that structural
						support has come from more involvement from Asian investors and domestic super funds.</p>
					<div>

The graph shows that domestic issuance has increased in recent years." width="" height="" loading="lazy">
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>With more issuers participating regularly and a deeper pool of investors, we have also heard that this has
						become a virtuous circle where ‘liquidity brings in more liquidity’ as connections deepen and
						conditions become more attractive to both issuers and investors. This deepening of the domestic bond
						market may be part of a broader trend where increased liquidity for new issuance and investor engagement
						have supported demand for Australian fixed-income products, including ABS.</p>
					<p>Australian issuers have of course raised capital directly in offshore markets for some time. But a
						deepening of the domestic market is a welcome development. It supports more diverse funding sources and
						greater wholesale market access, so benefits both issuers and investors.</p>
					<h2>Taking stock – and what’s next?</h2>
					<p>To conclude, securitisation markets have been resilient and market conditions have been very favourable
						for issuers this year despite some key headwinds. Over the past few years we’ve seen a broadening of
						issuers, borrowers and investors.</p>
					<p>How these trends play out from here will continue to shape the market in the period ahead. There will be
						many interesting questions.</p>
					<p>To what extent will the market continue to provide competition in the Australian financial system? If the
						past few years are any indication, securitisation will continue to be an important source of funding for
						some non-bank lenders. That includes those that may wish to expand their activities in markets less
						serviced by banks. The extent to which they expand further in these markets will depend on various
						factors, including demand for this type of lending and funding conditions more generally.</p>
					<p>How will the market weather an evolving economic environment? Much of the outlook for securitisation
						markets depends on the continued strong performance of the underlying collateral and the lending
						standards of issuers.</p>
					<p>And will a deepening investor base help foster the longer-run growth of market-based finance in Australia?
						While some of the strong investor demand for securitisation may reflect global cyclical factors and is
						therefore influenced by developments in offshore markets, a structural deepening of demand in

							<p id="fn1" aria-label="Endnote 1">Asset securitisation is the process of converting
								a pool of illiquid assets, such as residential mortgages, into tradeable securities. For further
								details, see Arsov I, I Kim and K Stacey (2015), ‘<a href="/publications/bulletin/2015/jun/6.html">Structural Features of Australian Residential

							<p id="fn2" aria-label="Endnote 2">Non-bank lenders that securitise loans are a

							<p id="fn4" aria-label="Endnote 4">My colleague Carl Schwartz spoke about these

									Change</a>’, Speech at the Australian Securitisation Conference, Sydney,

							</p>
							<p id="fn5" aria-label="Endnote 5">As discussed later, non-banks rely on
								securitisation as a source of funding far more than the banks, which means their ability to offer
								loans on competitive terms is more closely linked to conditions in securitisation markets. See
								Schwartz, n 4&nbsp;and De Zoysa V, J Dunphy and C Schwartz (2024), ‘<a href="/publications/bulletin/2024/apr/bank-funding-and-the-recent-tightening-of-monetary-policy.html">Bank
									Funding and the Recent Tightening of Monetary Policy’,</a> RBA <cite>Bulletin, </cite>
								April. The flipside of this (discussed later in the speech) is that while non-bank lenders cannot
								accept deposits for funding, they also have less onerous regulatory obligations. See Robinson M
								and S Tornielli di Crestvolant (2024), ‘<a href="/publications/bulletin/2024/apr/financial-stability-risks-from-non-bank-financial-intermediation-in-australia.html">Financial

							<p id="fn7" aria-label="Endnote 7">
								While banks are able to add or remove loans from the
								pool underlying a self-securitisation, APRA imposes strict rules to limit the active management
								of such pools. For more information, see Hughes A, ‘<a href="/publications/bulletin/2024/jul/how-the-rba-uses-the-securitisation-dataset-to-assess-financial-stability-risks-from-mortgage-lending.html">How
									the RBA Uses the Securitisation Dataset to Assess Financial Stability Risks from Mortgage
									Lending</a>’, RBA <cite>Bulletin</cite>, July. <a href="#r7" aria-label="Back to content">[7]</a>
							</p>
							<p id="fn8" aria-label="Endnote 8">The RBA’s Securitisation Database comprises
								loan-level data on the assets ‘backing’ many ABS issues, reported as a condition for an
								ABS to be eligible as collateral in the RBA’s market operations. The Securitisation Database
								provides timely and detailed information on mortgages underlying marketed RMBS and
								self-securitisations, and complements other datasets for monitoring the financial stability risks
								associated with mortgage lending in Australia. Work by the RBA has shown that this dataset
								broadly represents the wider Australian mortgage market across many important dimensions such as
								the composition of lending, borrower type and loan types. For more information, see Hughes, n 7,
								and Fernandes K and D Jones (2018), ‘<a href="/publications/bulletin/2018/dec/the-reserve-banks-securitisation-dataset.html">The
									Reserve Bank’s Securitisation Dataset</a>’, RBA <cite>Bulletin</cite>, December. <a href="#r8" aria-label="Back to content">[8]</a>
							</p>
							<p id="fn9" aria-label="Endnote 9">The comparison is largely affected by a couple of
								things. One is the changing split of the RMBS market between banks and non-banks – given
								each tend to make different types of loans. Second is changes in lending preferences for each
								lender type. A potential third factor that can affect comparisons in this chart is any difference
								between the loans underlying banks’ marketed RMBS and those they self-securitised; however,
								this has not been a major driver of compositional changes between marketed RMBS and
								self-securitisations. <a href="#r9" aria-label="Back to content">[9]</a>
							</p>
							<p id="fn10" aria-label="Endnote 10">Low- and alt-doc loans are often used by
								borrowers with irregular income sources, such as self-employed individuals or those with
								non-traditional income sources. These still require significantly more verification than the
								‘no doc’ loans that became prevalent abroad ahead of the global financial crisis. <a href="#r10" aria-label="Back to content">[10]</a>
							</p>
							<p id="fn11" aria-label="Endnote 11">In late 2014, APRA announced a policy that
								required banks to limit their lending to housing investors. In early 2017, APRA imposed limits on
								interest-only mortgages. These limits have since been removed and replaced with longer-term
								solutions. For further details, see Garvin N, A Kearney and C Rosé (2021), ‘<a href="/publications/rdp/2021/2021-07/">Macroprudential Limits on Mortgage Products: The

							<p id="fn14" aria-label="Endnote 14">APRA does have the power to directly influence
								non-bank lending standards if they pose a material risk to financial stability. For more
								information, see Hudson <cite>et al</cite>, n 2. <a href="#r14" aria-label="Back to content">[14]</a>
							</p>
							<p id="fn15" aria-label="Endnote 15">Securitisers’ funding comes mostly through
								warehouse facilities during the loan origination phase, and then from the securitisation market
								once loans are packaged and sold to investors. Warehouse facilities act like a line of credit and
								are collateralised by the securitisers’ originated loans. For more information, see Hudson
								<cite>et al</cite>, n 2. <a href="#r15" aria-label="Back to content">[15]</a>

							<p id="fn19" aria-label="Endnote 19">For non-banks more broadly (i.e. beyond
								securitisation), housing arrears are also not high from a historical perspective but they have
								risen more rapidly than banks’ arrears in the current monetary policy tightening phase. This
								more rapid increase reflects, in part, prime borrowers refinancing their loans from non-banks to
								banks: see RBA, n 3. <a href="#r19" aria-label="Back to content">[19]</a>
