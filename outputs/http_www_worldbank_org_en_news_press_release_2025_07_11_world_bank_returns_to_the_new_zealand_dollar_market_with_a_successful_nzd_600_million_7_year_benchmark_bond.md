_“It’s fantastic to see the World Bank break the recent hiatus in the Kauri market. The World Bank has shown that their ongoing investor engagement and diligent approach to the market provides a strong foundation for market access. It was particularly great to see an enhanced breadth of domestic participation given their investor outreach activities,” said,_ **Simon Eckhoff, Director, Syndicate & Debt Capital Markets, ANZ**.

_“Congratulations to the World Bank for successfully reopening the Kauri market after 18 months of no issuance from SSA issuers. The World Bank timed the transaction well, taking advantage of improving pricing relativities. The deal attracted a strong and diverse orderbook, with broad investor participation, which is a testament to the strength of the following of the World Bank investor base. Several supportive dynamics contributed to the outcome including the scarcity of recent Kauri supply, tightening secondary spreads, a stable basis swap environment and renewed demand for NZD SSA bonds.  CBA is proud to have supported the World Bank on this important transaction,” said,_ **Desmond Fennell, Head of Capital Markets and Syndicate, Commonwealth Bank of Australia**
