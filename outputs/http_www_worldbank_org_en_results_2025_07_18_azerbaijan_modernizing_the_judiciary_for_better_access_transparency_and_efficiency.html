        <h3 class="lp__lead_mdtitle"><strong>Challenges</strong></h3><p>Azerbaijan’s judiciary has long grappled with structural and institutional challenges. Chief among them have been persistent concerns about the lack of efficiency and transparency in judicial processes. The country has seen a tenfold increase in demand in the past decade, with caseloads increasing from about 22,000 civil and commercial cases in 2010 to nearly 240,000 in 2023. Traditional courts used to take 187 days on average to process a case through the system. Case backlogs and delays in the delivery of justice have been compounded by limited infrastructure and insufficient resources. The judiciary has also struggled to adapt to new technologies, hindering efforts to modernize its processes. While the judiciary has made significant strides in enacting reforms over the years, these ongoing challenges have highlighted the need for further efforts to ensure a fair, efficient, and transparent judicial system.</p><figure class="lp__body_content_full_size"> <img src="https://worldbank.scene7.com/is/image/worldbankprod/az-Oguz-District-Court-old-paper-files-780?wid=780&amp;hei=439&amp;qlt=85,0&amp;resMode=sharp" class="img-responsive" alt="Azerbaijan: Modernizing the Judiciary " title="" id="fig_943c44ab76c047f280903b4f94054dcb_1"><figcaption aria-describedby="fig_943c44ab76c047f280903b4f94054dcb_1">Old paper-based files at the Oguz District Court have now been digitized.</figcaption></figure><h3 class="lp__lead_mdtitle"><strong>Approach&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P144700"><strong>Judicial Services and Smart Infrastructure Project</strong></a> was designed to leverage state-of-the-art smart infrastructure to enhance the efficiency and transparency of the judiciary and improve access to judicial services. As well as new court complexes, the project included new digital infrastructure, such as e-court services and AI tools, and innovative approaches to facilitate access for those in need, such as legal aid and alternative dispute resolution.</p><p>Collaboration was central to the initiative, bringing together key stakeholders such as the Judicial-Legal Council, Ministry of Justice, judiciary, and representatives of the legal profession. A strong emphasis was also placed on building institutional capacity, with dedicated training for judicial staff to ensure the effective use and maintenance of the new systems and technologies.</p><p>The judicial reforms in Azerbaijan were part of a broader <a>strategy</a>&nbsp;aimed at modernizing the legal framework and enhancing governance. These reforms are crucial for transitioning from a public sector-led growth model to one where the public sector serves as a facilitator rather than the main driver of economic development.</p><h3 class="lp__lead_mdtitle"><strong>Results</strong></h3><p>Between 2014 and 2024, the <a href="https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P144700">Azerbaijan Judicial Services and Smart Infrastructure Project</a> delivered several key results that significantly improved the judicial system in the country.</p><p>A major achievement was the development ofmodern court infrastructure. The project financed <strong>completion of 12 new court complexes</strong> incorporating state-of-the-art technology, inclusive design elements such as ramps and amenities for visually impaired persons, and open, light-filled architecture to create a more welcoming environment. Investments in infrastructure and technology have allowed the judiciary to<strong> handle three times more cases than they did a decade ago, and to do so faster</strong>. Traditional courts used to take 187 days on average to process a case through the system; new courts do it in 119 days on average. Mandatory audio-video recording of court hearings in commercial cases has improved both transparency and consistency in procedures and judgments across courts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Two</strong> <strong>new data centers </strong>certified to Tier 3 international standards were also constructed, providing for safe and secure storage of judiciary data.</p><p>The project rolled out a <strong>nationwide e-court system</strong> across all court hearing rooms in Azerbaijan's six court jurisdictions. This digital platform <strong>enhanced the efficiency and transparency of judicial processes</strong> by automating case management, enabling electronic filing and proceedings, and ensuring mandatory audio-video recording of hearings. The project also advanced the use of Business Intelligence and AI in judicial operations, developing prototypes using these tools to enhance service delivery and performance measurement and management. For example, enhanced visualization—such as heatmaps and traffic light systems—help to quickly detect and resolve poor performance hotspots.</p><p>To promote equitable access to justice, free legal services forcitizens were provided through <strong>Women's Resource Centers in 14 regions</strong>. This was part of a broader effort to enhance the delivery of judicial services and ensure that all citizens, especially vulnerable populations, have access to legal assistance. Overall, 70,000 citizens benefited from legal aid services established under the project.</p><p><strong>User satisfaction with access, transparency, and efficiency of selected justice services</strong> was another important outcome of the project. The most recent court user survey showed a user satisfaction rate of 69.3% and 77% among citizens and professional users respectively, up from 44.6% and 49% at the beginning of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The World Bank has also helped the judiciary respond to sudden surges in demand. In 2016, for example, the number of civil and commercial cases spiked to 470,000—double the current volume. Analysis revealed that these were largely non-litigious, linked to the country's 2015 currency devaluation and difficulties in servicing contractual and debt obligations. Judges and court personnel rang the alarm and—with support from the World Bank—developed an online solution to streamline and fast-track these cases to provide solutions for debtors and creditors and free up resources for litigious cases.</p><figure class="lp__body_content_full_size"> <img src="https://worldbank.scene7.com/is/image/worldbankprod/az-New-Sumgayit-Court-780?wid=780&amp;hei=439&amp;qlt=85,0&amp;resMode=sharp" class="img-responsive" alt="Azerbaijan: Modernizing the Judiciary " title="" id="fig_943c44ab76c047f280903b4f94054dcb_2"><figcaption aria-describedby="fig_943c44ab76c047f280903b4f94054dcb_2">Façade of the Sumgayit Court Complex.</figcaption></figure><h3 class="lp__lead_mdtitle"><strong>World Bank Contribution</strong></h3><p>An initial World Bank loan of $100 million was signed on October 22, 2014. Additionally, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved an additional financing of $50 million on March 26, 2020, to further support the project's objectives.</p><h3 class="lp__lead_mdtitle"><strong>Partnerships</strong></h3><p>The United Nations Development Programme was a key partner in expanding access to justice in Azerbaijan. It supported free legal services through Women’s Resource Centers operating in 14 regions, with a strong focus on reaching vulnerable groups. This initiative complemented a wider set of judicial reforms supported by other development partners, including the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, helping to strengthen legal services and promote fairness across the justice system.</p><h3 class="lp__lead_mdtitle"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h3><p>The project has had a transformative impact on Azerbaijan’s judiciary, laying a strong foundation for continued systemic reform. Further justice sector reforms will be crucial to better support businesses and private sector development. Streamlining legal processes and creating a more predictable judicial environment will foster a stronger, more attractive climate for business and investment.</p><p>Building on this project’s success, future efforts should prioritize sustained investment in digital infrastructure. The success of the project’s IT upgrades—particularly in improving transparency and efficiency—demonstrates the value of further expanding artificial intelligence and business intelligence tools to drive smarter, data-informed judicial management.</p><p>Finally, it is essential that future reforms consider inclusivity as a cornerstone. This means ensuring that all segments of the population, particularly vulnerable groups, and citizens in remote areas, have equal access to justice.</p>
