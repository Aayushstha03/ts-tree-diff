All growth rates for the financial aggregates are seasonally adjusted, and adjusted for the effects of breaks in the series as recorded in the notes to the tables listed below. Data for the levels of financial aggregates are not adjusted for series breaks, and growth rates should not be calculated from data on the levels of credit. Historical levels and growth rates for the financial aggregates have been revised owing to the resubmission of data by some financial intermediaries, the re-estimation of seasonal factors and the incorporation of securitisation data. The RBA credit aggregates measure credit provided by financial institutions operating domestically. They do not capture cross-border or non-intermediated lending.

Since the July 2019 release, the financial aggregates have incorporated an improved conceptual framework and a new data collection. This is referred to as the Economic and Financial Statistics (EFS) collection. For more information, see [Updates to Australia’s Financial Aggregates](/publications/bulletin/2019/mar/updates-to-australias-financial-aggregates.html) and the [July 2019 Financial Aggregates](/statistics/frequency/fin-agg/2019/fin-agg-0719.html).

Since the March 2023 release, series that exclude lending to warehouse trusts in business credit were added to the financial aggregates. More information is available in the [Change Notice published 21 April 2023](/statistics/tables/changes-to-tables.html#d20230421).
