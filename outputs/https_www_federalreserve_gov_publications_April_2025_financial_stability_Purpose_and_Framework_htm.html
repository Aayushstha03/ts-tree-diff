                <h3>Purpose and Framework</h3>
                <!-- Article Area -->
                <p>This report presents the Federal Reserve Board's current assessment of the stability of the U.S.
                    financial system. By publishing this report, the Board intends to promote public understanding by
                    increasing transparency around, and creating accountability for, the Federal Reserve's views on this
                    topic. Financial stability supports the objectives assigned to the Federal Reserve, including full
                    employment and stable prices, a safe and sound banking system, and an efficient payments system.</p>
                <p>A financial system is considered stable when banks, other lenders, and financial markets are able to
                    provide households, communities, and businesses with the financing they need to invest, grow, and
                    participate in a well- functioning economy—and can do so even when hit by adverse events, or
                    "shocks."</p>
                <p>Consistent with this view of financial stability, the Federal Reserve Board's monitoring framework
                    distinguishes between shocks to, and vulnerabilities of, the financial system. Shocks are inherently
                    difficult to predict, while vulnerabilities, which are the aspects of the financial system that
                    would exacerbate stress, can be monitored as they build up or recede over time. As a result, the
                    framework focuses primarily on assessing vulnerabilities, with an emphasis on four broad categories
                    and how those categories might interact to amplify stress in the financial system.<a href="#f1"
                        id="f1r" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
                <p>The Federal Reserve's monitoring framework also tracks domestic and international developments to
                    identify near-term risks—that is, plausible adverse developments or shocks that could stress the
                    U.S. financial system. The analysis of these risks focuses on assessing how such potential shocks
                    may spread through the U.S. financial system, given our current assessment of vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p>While this framework provides a systematic way to assess financial stability, some potential risks
                    may be novel or difficult to quantify and therefore are not captured by the current approach. Given
                    these complications, we rely on ongoing research by the Federal Reserve staff, academics, and other
                    experts to improve our measurement of existing vulnerabilities and to keep pace with changes in the
                    financial system that could create new forms of vulnerabilities or add to existing ones.</p>

                    of the financial system</h4>
                <p>The assessment of financial vulnerabilities informs Federal Reserve actions to promote the resilience
                    of the financial system. The Federal Reserve works with other domestic agencies directly and through
                    the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor risks to financial stability and to undertake
                    supervisory and regulatory efforts to mitigate the risks and consequences of financial instability.
                </p>
                <p>Actions taken by the Federal Reserve to promote the resilience of the financial system include its
                    supervision and regulation of financial institutions. In the aftermath of the 2007–09 financial
                    crisis, these actions have included requirements for more and higher-quality capital, an innovative
                    stress-testing regime, and new liquidity regulations applied to the largest banks in the United
                    States. In addition, the Federal Reserve's assessment of financial vulnerabilities informs decisions
                    regarding the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The CCyB is designed to increase the resilience
                    of large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses and to promote
                    a more sustainable supply of credit over the economic cycle.</p>
