				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>Results of the second-quarter 2025 survey&nbsp;| Vol.&nbsp;22.2&nbsp;| July&nbsp;21, 2025</p>
<p class="lead">The Business Outlook Survey was conducted by in-person, video and phone interviews from May&nbsp;8 to 28, 2025. The Business Leaders’ Pulse is conducted online every month; the latest results are from April, May and June&nbsp;2025.

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs and related uncertainty, along with spillover effects on the Canadian and global economies, continue to have major impacts on businesses’ outlooks. However, the worst-case scenarios that firms envisioned last quarter are now seen as less likely to occur.</li>
<li>Sales outlooks remain pessimistic overall due to widespread concerns about the broader effects of a slowing economy. But recent monthly survey results suggest some improvement in firms’ outlooks—particularly among exporters—because few have been directly affected by the current tariffs.</li>
<li>Uncertainty continues to drive cautiousness in outlooks for hiring and investment. Most firms expect to maintain current staffing levels and limit investment to regular maintenance over the next 12&nbsp;months.</li>
<li>For some, cost increases due to tariffs and trade uncertainty have materialized. Affected firms see weak demand and competition as constraining their ability to pass cost increases on to their customers, although most still plan for some pass-through.</li>
<li>Businesses’ expectations for short-term inflation have returned to levels reported at the end of 2024.</li>

<p>Tariffs and trade tensions continue to weigh on the outlooks of many firms. In some cases, the negative effects on costs and sales that most businesses predicted last quarter have materialized, and firms expect them to persist.</p>
<p>At the same time, firms have moderated their expectations for negative impacts, as the worst-case trade scenarios they anticipated last quarter now appear less likely (<a href="#chart1">Chart&nbsp;1</a>). For example, around two-thirds of firms expected higher tariff-related costs last quarter compared with only one-third this quarter.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>Last quarter, firms described the economic environment as highly unpredictable, which made it difficult for them to form a clear outlook for the year ahead. This quarter, more firms can now form an outlook with greater confidence, although they still report that it is hard or somewhat hard to do so. Fewer businesses are considering extremely negative scenarios in their planning.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, uncertainty around financial, economic and political conditions remains the top concern for firms. While worries about tariffs directly affecting Canadian businesses have eased slightly, new concerns have emerged about the broader impacts of tariffs on the global economy and on demand in Canada. Uncertainty is still causing firms to hold off on new investment plans and to conservatively manage their finances, among other actions (<a href="#box1">Box&nbsp;1</a>).</p>
<p>Business sentiment, although still subdued, has improved from the sharp declines recorded in March and April&nbsp;2025 (<a href="#chart2">Chart&nbsp;2</a>). Both the previous declines and the recent rebound were seen across exporters and non-exporters, though sentiment among exporters in particular fell sharply during the earlier stage of the trade conflict. Similarly, the share of firms planning for a recession in Canada has declined slightly—from 32% to 28%—but remains above 2024 levels, reflecting ongoing concerns about trade tensions.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h2>Weak demand is broad-based</h2>
<p>Firms’ near-term sales expectations weakened in the second quarter of 2025. The balance of opinion on indicators of future sales has turned negative as tariff-related impacts have materialized. More firms reported their indicators (e.g., order books, advance bookings and sales inquiries) have deteriorated compared with 12&nbsp;months ago than those that reported their indicators have improved (<a href="#chart3">Chart&nbsp;3</a>). This weakness is largely driven by broad spillover effects from the trade conflict, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>weak spending on services and capital goods by business customers</li>
<li>low consumer spending or concerns that consumers could start to spend less</li>
<li>weak outlooks in the housing sector</li>
<li>soft sales outlooks among oil and gas firms because of downward pressure on global oil prices</li>
</ul>
<p>For exporters, weakness in near-term sales indicators partly reflects the pull-forward of exports earlier in the year before tariffs were imposed, which was followed by a slowdown because clients had already stocked up on goods.</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><p>Despite this, the direct impacts tariffs are having on firms’ outlooks are less severe than in the first quarter. Outlooks have improved among businesses strongly affected by trade tensions because the tariffs that have materialized so far are less broad-based than those feared earlier in the year. Most exporters in the Bank of Canada’s business surveys reported not currently being subject to tariffs. This is reflected in improved expectations for export sales growth (<a href="#chart4">Chart&nbsp;4</a>). However, in special consultations with Bank staff, exporters currently facing sectoral US tariffs—including manufacturers of steel and aluminum products and firms in the auto sector—continued to report weak outlooks.</p>

As a result, many businesses expect their selling prices to increase over the coming year at a similar rate as they did over the past year (<a href="#chart10">Chart&nbsp;10</a>). Because customers are sensitive to price increases, many firms are absorbing a portion of these increased costs, compressing their profit margins in an effort to preserve market share (<a href="#chart11">Chart&nbsp;11</a>).</p>

				<div class="cfct-mod-content"><h2 id="box1">Box&nbsp;1: Firms and consumers report that uncertainty is affecting their planning</h2>
<p>Roughly half of participants in the Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey reported difficulty forecasting conditions for their business in the near term. Firms talked about how forming an outlook is complicated in the current environment because of multiple layers of uncertainty. One of the clearest sources of uncertainty is that changing trade policies mean that businesses do not know if and when tariffs will be imposed and how long they will last. This particularly affects firms directly involved in international trade.</p>
<p>Another source of uncertainty for firms is the uncertainty generated among consumers because of the trade conflict. In the Bank’s Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations, a higher-than-usual share of consumers said the future is particularly hard to predict right now. Households are reacting to uncertainty by reducing spending, delaying major purchases, and increasing savings (<a href="#chart1a">Chart&nbsp;1-A</a>, panel a). This, in turn, makes it more difficult for businesses to understand how demand conditions will evolve.</p> 
<p>Faced with high uncertainty, firms are reluctant to make costly and hard-to-reverse decisions that may not be appropriate if trade policy or economic conditions change.<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1" title="For more details on how uncertainty impacts businesses’ decisions and the broader economy, see T. Macklem, “Tariffs and trade uncertainty are hurting the Canadian economy,” (speech delivered to Calgary Economic Development, Calgary, Alberta, March&nbsp;20, 2025) and Bank of Canada, “How economic uncertainty disrupts investment,” The Economy, Plain and Simple (July 2025)." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a> Many businesses are pausing or rethinking their plans and exhibiting more cautiousness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly one-quarter of firms reported reducing their investment or employment plans (<a href="#chart1a">Chart&nbsp;1-A</a>, panel b).</li>
<ul>
<li>This includes holding off on hiring; the share of firms planning to keep staffing levels roughly the same over the coming year is at survey highs.</li>
<li>Similarly, many businesses talked about going ahead with investment plans that are already in progress but refraining from new capital expenditures designed to expand capacity or improve productivity. For example, many home builders said they are delaying new projects due to uncertainty around sales expectations and construction costs.</li>
</ul>
<li>Some firms are working to de-risk their balance sheets to allow them to better withstand financial shocks. This includes activities such as paying down debt, holding on to more cash and, for financial intermediaries, increasing allowances for loan losses.</li>
<li>In Bank surveys and during Governing Council outreach events in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario this quarter, firms noted that their management teams have to devote significant attention to navigate trade uncertainty, including scenario planning and identifying alternative suppliers or customers. Businesses noted that this leads to less time and attention available to grow their business.</li>
