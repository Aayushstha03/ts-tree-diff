<p>Measures of underlying inflation (the so-called core inflation measures) -- obtained by removing transitory disturbances from the actual movements observed in the consumer prices -- are frequently used for inflation analysis. Instead of focusing on a specific core inflation measure, a comprehensive examination of various core inflation measures enables us to identify the trends of price movements in a more accurate manner.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's Research and Statistics Department releases the following four estimates in line with the monthly release of the official CPI for Japan: the diffusion index of increasing/decreasing items; the trimmed mean; the mode; and the weighted median. </p>
<p>These estimates are, in principle, released at 2:00 p.m., two business days after the release of the official CPI for Japan.</p>
<p>For more information on the estimation procedures and characteristics of these core inflation measures, please see the <em>Bank of Japan Review Series</em> below.</p>
