                    <h3>The Federal Reserve Board's Role</h3>
<p>As the issuing authority for all Federal Reserve notes, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has a wide range of responsibilities related to paper money, from ensuring an adequate supply to protecting and maintaining confidence in our currency. Together with our partners at the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department</a>, its <a href="http://www.moneyfactory.gov/">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</a>, and the <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/">United States Secret Service</a>, we continuously monitor the counterfeiting threats for each denomination and make redesign decisions based on these threats.</p>
